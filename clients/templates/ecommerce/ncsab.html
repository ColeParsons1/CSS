<h2>Basic Information & Schedules including what to expect on your first day of school…</h2>
<h2>On your first day of school, Monday, you will have an orientation covering school policies and procedures. You’ll receive your textbooks and supplies and meet your fellow starting students (juniors) as well as the students 3 months ahead of you (seniors). Then you will go right into the first chapter lecture in massage.</h2>
<h2>Moving forward, on Tuesday you will start directly with the “Cells & Tissues” lecture. Bring a notepad or your laptop. On Wednesday, you will hear the basics of what structural bodywork is and begin to learn the vocabulary.</h2>
<h2>You will learn your bones first over the first couple of weeks; then, over the months to follow, you will add muscle groups to those bones.</h2>
<h2>Thursday, you will get on the tables to learn to touch and compress muscles. … That’s your first week.</h2>
<h2>Moving forward, you will learn a new chapter or muscle group each day and test at the end of each chapter or muscle group.</h2>
<h2>The instructors are seasoned and have been teaching for us for a long time. They are passionate and continue their own education to expand the knowledge they bring to the table. … Their gifts are the soul of our school. We are a family, and you will make lifelong friends here.</h2>
<h2>At the North Carolina School of Advanced Bodywork, we want all of our students to feel at ease and comfortable as you start your education in our 650-hour Professional Massage & Bodywork Therapy Program.</h2>
<h2>We are a small, boutique school and will give you a toolbox of knowledge, giving you the ability to provide a great, relaxing, stress-reducing massage as well as treat soft tissue dysfunction.</h2>
<h2>Chronic pain lives in the soft tissues. … Sciatica, plantar fasciitis, low back pain, thoracic outlet syndrome, and frozen shoulder … all are soft tissue issues.</h2>

<h2>The following information gives a brief description of the curriculum within NCSAB’s Professional Massage and Bodywork Therapy Program.</h2>
<h2>Each day is dedicated to one of the four program divisions and will address a number of subjects to satisfy specific state requirements while ensuring that the integrity of the information remains superior.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Anatomy & Physiology</h2>
<h2>Anatomy & Physiology aims to enable the student to most effectively design massage therapy techniques through an understanding of the human body. This course includes Anatomy and Physiology I and II, presented on separate days.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">1. Anatomy & Physiology I: Body Systems and Pathology</h2>
<h2>Participation in this class introduces the student to the body’s major systems. Much attention will be placed on the structure (anatomy) and functionality (physiology) of the human body. Attention is also given to common pathologies of each system and their impact on appropriate massage protocol, as well as contraindications to massage. Discussions on how each system functions individually, with special emphasis on its relevance to the practice of massage therapy, will be integrated into the lecture.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">2. Anatomy & Physiology II: Functional Anatomy</h2>
<h2>The objective of this course is to provide you, the student, with academic and tactile knowledge of the body planes, bony landmarks, and muscular and skeletal systems. Through PowerPoint presentations, engaging lectures, supervised palpatory trades, and demonstrations, class participants will become enthralled with an extensive study of movement.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">3. Swedish Massage & Allied Modalities</h2>
<h2>The objective of this course is to familiarize the student with the basis from which most forms of massage derive. You will learn how massage is important and effective through engaging in discussions of the history and theory of massage and by experiencing its beneficial value through hands-on table work.</h2>
<h2>You will learn the classical 1-hour massage routine commonly used in spas and resorts and how to effectively employ all of the fundamental strokes. Further instruction will lead you to a more creative and intuitive massage representing your individuality.</h2>
<h2>This class covers Western modalities, introducing you to several massage techniques beyond Swedish massage. Additional topics covered include hydrotherapy, special populations, ethics, NC state laws and rules, and business practices of the professional massage and bodywork therapist.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">4. Clinical Massage & Structural Bodywork</h2>
<h2>The objective of this course is to introduce you to the clinical aspect of massage therapy and bodywork as it pertains to this program. The subject matter of Clinical Massage and Structural Bodywork focuses on postural imbalances and faulty body mechanics that introduce or perpetuate conditions within the body, as well as pain management and reconditioning for sustained injuries. This course provides you with the ability to identify and treat postural distortions and muscular imbalances often resulting in faulty and restricted movement patterns that can eventually lead to debilitating pain cycles or worse.</h2>
<h2>You will flourish with knowledge gained under the guidance of carefully chosen instructors selected for their excellence in presenting the subject matter in a dynamic and informative manner. The skills learned within this class are invaluable as the demand for pain intervention becomes a more prevalent necessity in today’s society.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Daily Class Schedule</h2>
<h2>Monday — (Swedish) This course covers laws, ethics, draping, body mechanics, principles and theory, indications/contraindications, pathology, somatic psychology, Western and Eastern theories and approaches, Thai-yoga bodywork, and a lot of supervised hands-on time to practice with fellow students.</h2>
<h2>Tuesday — (Anatomy & Physiology) This course covers the 10 physiological organ systems of the body. It is presented in an informative manner using texts, models, and PowerPoint presentations with chapter, midterm, and final challenges (tests) given.</h2>
<h2>Wednesday — (Functional Anatomy) This course covers in great detail the entire muscular system and how each muscle can play a role in pain. We will spend from 2–4 and even 5–7 weeks in a muscle compartment that is covered. You will receive a PowerPoint presentation, lecture, demonstrations with body drawing, and a lot of supervised hands-on time to practice your palpatory skills during student trades.</h2>
<h2>Thursday — (Clinical and Structural Bodywork) This course covers the many applications, evaluation methods, and clinical treatment strategies when working with postural distortions, impinged nerves, nerve entrapments and compressions, stiff and restricting joint movements, poor posture such as downward collapsed “stooped” posture and upward elevated “arched” posture, and many sports-related injuries, such as rotator cuff injuries, tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, and chronic failed back syndromes.</h2>
<h2>This is a hands-on class with much of the class devoted to practicing. The student trades are 90 minutes long with an instructor present for questions and answers. This class is where you develop your manual skills.</h2>
<h2>Our curriculum is a gradual process starting from basic terminology and bone anatomy that will progress into a deeper level of understanding of the human body and how and what makes it work efficiently.</h2>
<h2>My professionally published book <em>Structural Balancing: A Clinical Approach</em>, published by McGraw-Hill Publishing, is the primary textbook used for Wednesday and Thursday classes.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">TO OBTAIN AN APPLICATION:</h2>

<h2>Swedish massage, or full-body massage, is the primary type of massage offered in spas and massage franchises. It’s the massage modality that comes to mind when most people think of massage. The primary goal of Swedish massage is to relax the body.</h2>
<h2>Usually, a Swedish massage focuses on the entire body. Yet sometimes the therapist will, at a client’s request, focus only on specific areas of the body.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Swedish Massage Compared to Clinical Massage Therapy or Deep Tissue Therapy</h2>
<h2>The primary difference between Swedish massage and other forms of therapy—such as clinical massage therapy or deep tissue therapy—is that there is usually a definite focus on specific areas of the client’s body to relieve aches or pains, chronic tension, reduced range of motion, and other such afflictions.</h2>

<h2>Generally speaking, trigger points are usually referred to as “knots” or “tender points” in muscles.</h2>
<h2>More specifically, trigger point therapy addresses specific muscle fibers within particular muscles that trigger pain in other, or even distant, areas of the body. For instance, a trigger point in a specific muscle of the hip can mimic “sciatica” pain referral down the leg, causing the pain to travel down the leg away from the original site of injury or dysfunction.</h2>
<h2>A trigger point in a shoulder muscle can fire a painful response to the neck and head, causing a chronic neck problem such as headaches and restricted range of motion. Or it can trigger pain from the shoulder down to the elbow, wrist, and/or hand.</h2>
<h2>It is important for massage therapists to have extensive knowledge of trigger points and pain patterns so they are actually treating the source of the pain, not just chasing the symptoms.</h2>

<h2>Your pain may have a muscular component to it.</h2>
<h2>There are many sports that require repetitive use, and there are many athletes who overuse their bodies. Often, a small, minor injury can develop into a more chronic condition.</h2>
<h2>Baseball players often sustain rotator cuff injuries, which are directly related to muscle strains of the shoulder. If left untreated, their muscles, over time, will limit range of motion and cause friction and inflammation. Pain and weakness can be debilitating for any length of time.</h2>
<h2>Golfers often sustain hip and back injuries from the high-intensity twisting that is necessary for club head speed.</h2>
<h2>Runners often seek out sports massage therapists to help decrease muscular tension within their muscles, especially of the hips, thighs, calves, and feet.</h2>
<h2>Sports massage is a type of massage that is used to work on athletes, from professionals to weekend warriors alike. Sports massage doesn’t focus on a specific technique but aims to prevent and treat muscular problems arising from sports and exercise. Sports massage may be applied before, during, or after a specific sporting event or activity.</h2>

<h2>Deep Tissue Massage Therapy tends to be more focused on specific tissues addressing a specific complaint of the client.</h2>
<h2>There are many and varied approaches to deep tissue, with very different principles, techniques, and intentions.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">The Typical Deep Tissue Massage Approach</h2>
<h2>This Might or Might Not Be Too Deep, Depending on What Client is Feeling</h2>
<h2>There is often an assumption on the part of a typical deep tissue massage therapist that their “job” is to “dig in” really deep to “find” and “work out” the problems, such as “knots” in the muscle fibers.</h2>
<h2>For example, some deep tissue therapists treat the muscle very locally and in isolation, as if they were just “breaking up” the tensions, adhesions, scar tissues, calcifications, or other aspects of pain, dysfunction, or pathology-causing elements within the muscle itself. This approach is very often effective, even though the “science” behind what they are doing is questionable, to say the least.</h2>
<h2>However, many clients are too traumatized, stressed, injured, or “tissue-damaged” to endure really deep work. Or the client is too desensitized and is actually being hurt without knowing it. Some clients just cannot tolerate the pain, and then they look for a modality or practitioner that hurts less than the pain they already have!</h2>
<h2>Some Oriental muscle modalities use deep manual pressure to “stimulate or reduce the flow” of “chi energy” through the “meridians.” This approach relies on the Oriental Medicine philosophy that acupuncture and herbology come from and might require the client to have more of a “leap of faith” than some are willing to allow. The question is, how well does that model of the human body and pathology fit the problems the client presents with?</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">The NCSAB Approach To “Deep Tissue Massage”</h2>
<h2>At NCSAB, our overarching philosophy is, in great part, that excess nerve activity in the central nervous system (CNS) and brain sends motor signals to a muscle, causing the muscle fibers to excessively contract and very often stay (chronically) contracted. As long as that nerve charge is activated, the muscle (or organ) will stay activated and contracted and cannot relax.</h2>
<h2>Our medical massage and bodywork technique employs manual (hands-on) pressure on the muscle not to “treat the muscle” per se. We use manual pressure on the skin and muscle to stimulate certain nerve signals into the CNS and brain. (CNS = central nervous system.)</h2>
<h2>This stimulation, if done properly, causes the nerve pathways and synapses (synapses = “switches controlling nerve flow”) to “reset” the amount of nerve charge they are sending to the muscle(s) (or organs). That usually results in the reduction of nerve charge to the muscle or organ. That reduction of nerve charge to the muscle is the “relaxation,” the “de-contracting” of the muscle, and de-stressing of the neuro-musculo-fascial system.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Does Deep Tissue Massage Therapy Need to Hurt To Be Effective?</h2>
<h2>Deep Manual Pressure to Abdominal Wall & Psoas Muscles</h2>
<h2>As the client’s muscle(s) relax(es), the therapist’s fingers or hands, or even elbow, will sink deeper into the muscle belly. As the therapist sinks deeper, new layers of tension are often encountered, bringing up new levels of sensation (sometimes uncomfortable or even painful) to the client’s perception. It is the client’s job to give feedback to the therapist, letting them know they are going too deep, or too fast, or both.</h2>
<h2>The therapist then backs off slightly, or a lot, until the client’s neuromuscular tissue relaxes and the client is comfortable again. Then, the therapist can proceed to sink even deeper into the muscle belly. Clients often report that with this approach, the therapist can get much deeper into the tissue than “standard” deep tissue therapists do, and we can stay in the tissues longer, finding and releasing more of the chronically contracted muscle tissues.</h2>
<h2>In this way, deep tissue massage, done according to NCSAB Principles of Therapy (No Pain, MORE Gain), does not have to hurt to be effective.</h2>
<h2>In fact, in many cases, it is counterproductive or makes the client worse.</h2>
<h2>The amount of pressure can be similar to classic Swedish massage but focusing primarily on relieving tension in the deeper layers of muscles and fascial tissue. In Swedish-style therapy, the applied pressure will be deeper and the strokes much slower. Special attention may be given to problem areas of chronic tension.</h2>
<h2>So, even Swedish-style massage can be “deep tissue” if the client and therapist are patient enough to allow the tissues to relax and let go.</h2>

<h2>What Are The Differences Between Swedish Massage vs Structural Bodywork?</h2>
<h2>Swedish Massage vs Structural Bodywork? Which Would YOU Choose?</h2>
<h2>Notice: NCSAB is primarily a CLINICAL / MEDICAL Massage & Bodywork Therapy School. Yet we DO teach Swedish Massage as foundational to your training.</h2>
<h2>IMPORTANT NOTE: You’ll notice this and other pages indicate the focus of the North Carolina School of Advanced Bodywork is mostly on what many call Bodywork. Many therapists and consumers use the terms massage and bodywork more or less interchangeably. Yet there is a significant difference in usage, explained below in this article.</h2>
<h2>Yet we frequently use the term massage far more often than the term bodywork. That’s because “website success” is in great part dominated by Google Search Engine optimization strategies. The term bodywork hardly shows up in Google Trends Search, so we have to use the word massage as much as possible so Google can understand what our pages are about.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Relaxation, Spa Style Massage</h2>
<h2>Many, possibly most, massage therapists practice one or more forms of massage that are very relaxing and healthful, yet general in nature. While modalities like Swedish Massage and Asian Bodywork (such as Shiatsu and Acupressure) are very useful and valuable in many settings, there is a significant difference.</h2>
<h2>Such styles as Swedish massage have been utilized in America for well over a hundred years. It was given a big boost by John Harvey Kellogg. In an article from Massage Today Online Magazine, we read this:</h2>
<h2>John Harvey Kellogg’s accomplishments are impressive by any measure: Superintendent and surgeon at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, inventor of myriad medical and surgical instruments; the man behind the discovery of the therapeutic value of electric light and the sinusoidal current, founder of the health food industry at Battle Creek and last, but certainly not least, author of the groundbreaking book, “The Art of Massage” written in 1885.</h2>
<h2>Kellogg, a true “whole (or ‘natural’) health” physician, was far more than a massage therapist. Yet the system of massage Kellogg used in his practice, taught, and wrote about could generally be called the “Swedish” style of massage. Peter Ling of Sweden, a developer of the Swedish system, was acknowledged by Kellogg “for devoting his life to helping patients with research efforts into Swedish massage and gymnastics.” Swedish massage had a great impact on massage in America, but there was more to it than that. Again form the Massage Today article:</h2>
<h2>Kellogg spent many years researching his techniques, and was able to document the results of his hard work scientifically. He understood the value of massage and touch, defining it as “not simply an ordinary touch or contact of the hand with the body, but a skilled or professional touch. It is a touch applied with intelligence, with control, with a purpose, and simply as it is, capable of producing decided physiological effects.” Because of his investigations into the study and application of massage, he established beyond all question that “massage affords one of the most effective means of influencing the functions of the human body.”</h2>
<h2>As “modern” or “orthodox” medicine become more popular by the “quick fix” of drugs, surgery & radiation, massage, as well as other manipulative techniques such as osteopathy, naprapathy and chiropractic, fell by the wayside. Massage was even considered by many to be “quack” medicine.</h2>
<h2>And of course, the association with prostitution and other illicit activities became widespread and common.</h2>
<h2>In recent decades, however, massage has been making a comeback. Yet to a great degree, it is best known for the generally relaxing, long, firm stokes with oil, clients with clothing removed (but draped), often in a room with mood lighting and soft, relaxing music.</h2>
<h2>This is the type of massage work usually available in the Spa Environment, or massage clinics focusing exclusively on massage, where it’s all about general relaxation, de-stressing & tension reduction, pampering, and all that.</h2>
<h2>Sometimes the environment is quite luxurious and “up-scale” to accommodate wealthier clientele.</h2>
<h2>This kind of massage can indeed be very therapeutic, especially for generalized conditions of excessive stress and tension. Yet it is generally not very specific or targeted in its application.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Clinical / Medical Bodywork</h2>
<h2>The word bodywork, though not always defined this way, tends to refer to more targeted, therapeutically focused work, focused toward specific complaints a Client might have. Often done without oil or lotion, often with Client’s clothing still on, and the environment tending to be more “clinical” than relaxation or spa environment.</h2>
<h2>In the 1980s, the terms were further confused, however, when one (maybe many) individual(s) coined the term medical massage to refer what many of us were calling clinical bodywork or therapeutic bodywork.</h2>
<h2>And it is often the case some therapists will mix the many forms together in one session. They will, for one example, “loosen up” the muscles first with more generalized relaxation strokes, then apply more specific pressure to specific muscles for specific treatment. Others do it the other way around.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Your Massage & Bodywork Career Possibilities Are Truly Endless!</h2>
<h2>Our focus is PRIMARILY on YOU becoming a clinical / medical, soft tissue specialist in managing and resolving significant pain, posture, movement, and dysfunction issues for which many people have not found relief. If we didn’t have to worry about Google Search Engines and search terms, we’d be calling it clinical (or medical) structural bodywork.</h2>
<h2>And yes, we do feel our approach is indeed “advanced.”</h2>
<h2>Yet, in addition to our Leading Edge Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy & Structural Bodywork Training, you’ll receive excellent education in the skills of Swedish Massage, the more relaxing type of full body massage with oils and all that. This is all great and useful stuff, especially if you want to work in a spa setting or a franchise massage center.</h2>
<h2>You don’t HAVE to decide on Swedish Massage vs Structural Bodywork at this time. In fact, you can have a Practice where you offer BOTH!</h2>
<h2>Full-body Swedish massage might well be the original basis for most massage in modern America. Our highly accomplished Swedish massage instructor will provide you with top-of-the-line education in full body, therapeutic, relaxation & spa style massage. You’ll be very skilled in these modalities when you finish your program.</h2>
<h2>Yet you’ll have even more to offer … much more!</h2>
<h2>One interesting aspect of the health aspects of the more general style of Swedish Massage is the proven effect it has on the improved development of infants. Infant Massage has been demonstrated to improve growth of nerve tissue and other body systems.</h2>
<h2>Infant Massage might well be an excellent career opportunity for therapists with an affinity for families and children.</h2>
<h2>By virtue of the skin’s close association with the central nervous system, this cutaneous stimulation is literally awakening organic functions in the newborns’ internal organs, and without it their chances of survival are markedly diminished.</h2>
<h2>Even those who had been previously retarded showed dramatic increases in their weight, height, energy, and mental acuity. In institution after institution, the mystery of infant merasmus* was cleared up: The tactile stimulation associated with tender, loving care was absolutely crucial to a baby’s development. Without it, no amount of food and no kind of medicine could produce a healthy individual.</h2>

<h2>Our Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy & Structural Bodywork training is a very different therapeutic discipline compared to Swedish, relaxation, spa, or other Asian or “energy” related therapies. We are primarily focused on Western, science-based and medical approaches for the millions of people suffering from acute and chronic pain, injury and trauma related issues.</h2>
<h2>We also provide you with skills for achieving optimum physical performance of the neuro-musculo-fascial & joint system for Clients such as athletes, construction workers, musicians and others who use their bodies in their work or other activities on a frequent or daily basis.</h2>
<h2>There is also the effect of excess muscle tension and stress on the aging process. Teaching and facilitating Clients how to feel, relax, lengthen and balance their muscles can have a profound effect on reducing the aging effects of C.E.M.&.N.T. or (Chronic, Excess Muscle & Nerve Tension & Stress).</h2>
<h2>Just one of countless examples is the dental hygienist who’s sitting in a twisted and distorted body posture under high levels of stress, for many hours every day. Such work produces many muscular imbalances, in turn creating various aches, pains and other dysfunction.</h2>
<h2>Professional musicians, typists, and others using the same small muscles ever day are also subject to repetitive strain syndrome. Yet most of the time, this is just a matter of “tight muscles,” what we more precisely call C.E.M.&.N.T. (or chronic, excess muscle & nerve tension & stress).</h2>
<h2>The term C.E.M.&N.T. was coined by David Scott Lynn, the Original Founder of many of the Techniques we teach at the Schools of Advanced Bodywork.</h2>
<h2>And those who are not in pain, yet want better posture, movement, balance and coordination, to feel better in general, will be amazed at the results you produce. There is an entire market in corporate and industrial America for working with clients who must sit in front of computers or run machinery all day long, suffering from poor posture and repetitive strain injuries.</h2>

<h2>Our Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy School provides you the ability to understand and effectively identify and manipulate the soft tissues of the body.</h2>
<h2>Such knowledge is important for the purpose of reducing specific conditions of chronic, excess muscle and nerve tension and stress, contributing to the onset of pain and dysfunction and symptoms of premature aging.</h2>
<h2>We offer in-depth examination and understanding of anatomy & kinesiology, helping understand the various causes, symptoms and conditions of neuro-musculo-fascial tension and the principles to reverse that tension and stress.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Structural Analysis & Balancing</h2>
<h2>You will learn to scientifically track down the structural sources of aches, pains, and dysfunctions not sufficiently responsive to the usual localized treatment (at the location of symptoms such as pain or restricted motion) of neuromuscular and myofascial structures.</h2>
<h2>When you add the scientific elements of clinical massage and structural bodywork to our No Pain, More Gain “Edge” Technique and Structural Analysis & Balancing Strategies, you’ll get the most results in the widest range of myofascial and neuro/myo-structural syndromes. And though Western in nature, we believe, our approach is a no less of a “conscious” system than some of the more esoteric and Eastern modalities out there.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Legal Definitions of Massage & Bodywork</h2>
<h2>Legally speaking, the definition of “massage” actually covers “bodywork” as we are defining it here. According to many state statutes, they are synonymous terms. Yet many therapists prefer the term bodywork, or such as myo-therapy or muscle therapy, to distinguish their work from the relaxation, spa style of work. From the point-of-view of most, if not all laws in America, the distinctions of Swedish Massage vs Structural Bodywork do not make any legal difference.</h2>
<h2>One legal definition of “massage” is:</h2>
<h2>A system of manual therapy performed by a formally trained, often licensed practitioner that focuses on the application and principles of therapeutic massage to reduce musculoskeletal pain and promote healing, relaxation, and overall health.</h2>
<h2>And one from the Florida Massage Statutes:</h2>
<h2>“Massage” means the manipulation of the soft tissues of the human body with the hand, foot, arm, or elbow, whether or not such manipulation is aided by hydrotherapy, including colonic irrigation, or thermal therapy; any electrical or mechanical device; or the application to the human body of a chemical or herbal preparation.</h2>
<h2>Another, more specific definition from the Arizona Statutes on Massage Therapy is:</h2>
<h2>3. “Bodywork therapy” means massage therapy.</h2>
<h2>4. “Massage therapist” means a person who is licensed under this chapter to engage in the practice of massage therapy.</h2>
<h2>5. “Massage therapy” means the following that are undertaken to increase wellness, relaxation, stress reduction, pain relief and postural improvement or provide general or specific therapeutic benefits:</h2>
<h2>(a) The manual application of compression, stretch, vibration or mobilization of the organs and tissues beneath the dermis, including the components of the musculoskeletal system, peripheral vessels of the circulatory system and fascia, when applied primarily to parts of the body other than the hands, feet and head.</h2>
<h2>(b) The manual application of compression, stretch, vibration or mobilization using the forearms, elbows, knees or feet or handheld mechanical or electrical devices.</h2>
<h2>(c) Any combination of range of motion, directed, assisted or passive movements of the joints.</h2>
<h2>(d) Hydrotherapy, including the therapeutic applications of water, heat, cold, wraps, essential oils, skin brushing, salt glows and similar applications of products to the skin.</h2>
<h2>So the Arizona Statutes consider massage and bodywork to be more or less synonymous terms. Yet the Swedish massage vs bodywork question is not rigidly defined or settled. In fact, back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was in the massage industry quite a controversy going on as to what exactly the terms meant, and how they should be used.</h2>
<h2>Eventually, it was decided to use them individually to indicate different modes or intent of therapy.</h2>
<h2>These elements will be a primary focus of your training, and will prepare you for private practice or employment upon graduation from FloridaSAB.</h2>

<h2>The great thing is we see Swedish style massage as an excellent way to get more familiar with your sense of touch and how to contact another human body, and how to work with people. Yet you don’t have to decide on the direction of your professional focus until you’re out of school and more sure which way you want to go. … And you might decide to include both in your practice.</h2>

<h2>In modern society, the Power of Touch Therapy in Massage & Bodywork is vastly under-appreciated, yet highly valuable to MANY people. People who will be Your Clients …</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Living On The Leading Edge of Advanced Bodywork and Life Itself</h2>
<h2>As you get to know us, you’ll understand more about The Edge. It is one of our central keys to providing great bodywork for people and managing many of the aspects of your own life and self.</h2>
<h2>The short story is that too many people think that what some people call deep tissue therapy has to be painful to work. On the other hand, there are therapists who seldom, or never, work deep enough. This leads to many customer complaints that a therapist works either too deep or not deep enough.</h2>
<h2>But that’s different for every client, and the amount of pressure needs to be adjusted for each client, at different times. One level of pressure does not fit everyone, and it often changes quite a lot, even within the same massage or bodywork session.</h2>
<h2>Therapists who think they always know intuitively how much pressure is “just right” are probably kidding themselves much of the time. Yes, you will get better at intuiting how much is Just The Right Pressure. Yet there are always clients with “surprises” hiding in the soft tissues that almost make them jump off the table. Or as least be very uncomfortable.</h2>
<h2>The best results come when your Client is well within their Edges of pain, meaning they LIKE (or are neutral about) what they are feeling, and are not having to tolerate the pressure you are applying to their skin, muscles, and fascia.</h2>
<h2>Clients should be INVITING, not FIGHTING, the sensations you, the therapist, are stimulating in their body. Intensity of Sensation is fine. But NOT if the sensation is so much they start to RESIST what you’re doing.</h2>
<h2>They should be RELAXING into the pressure you stimulate with your therapy, not RESISTING it.</h2>
<h2>Therefore, the Goldilocks Rule works well. Some pressure it too much, some is not enough, and some is Just Right! It’s our job to help you learn to find and apply that just right pressure for each client.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Working With The Neurology Of the Body</h2>
<h2>Working with The Edge keeps you, the therapist, and your Client, focused on the internal relaxation and tension release process, making deep neurological connections, increasing the effectiveness, efficiency and results of your work.</h2>
<h2>For one thing, much of the power of touch therapy in massage & bodywork is their influence on the parasympathetic nerve system. This system is responsible for the healing, regeneration, rebuilding, and immune functions of the body. (That’s compared to the better known Sympathetic system, the Fright, Freeze, Fight or Flight system.)</h2>
<h2>The parasympathetic system responds best to light to medium stimulation, and not so well to high intensity stimulation. In fact, very strong stimulus tends to turn the parasympathetic system down as the sympathetic — the fight or flight — system turns UP.</h2>
<h2>So if you have a practice focused primarily on working with and healing the soft tissue issues of your clients, you’ll want to avoid working too deeply, too fast. Too much intensity of sensation, especially if it’s painful, can work against your beneficial and healing intentions.</h2>
<h2>Like much of what you’ll be learning with us, there’s A LOT more to power of touch therapy in massage & bodywork than that simple description describes.</h2>
<h2>Yes, our techniques treat the “deep tissues.” Many say we go far deeper into the muscle and fascia than most. The trick is to let the skin and surface tissues “release” first, THEN go deeper into the more superficial levels of muscle fibers, allowing the No Pain, MORE Gain process to work. THEN sink into the deeper muscle fibers.</h2>
<h2>It takes a little more time, but is far more effective and efficient. You’ll learn to deliver “deeper bodywork” with no significant levels of discomfort or pain necessarily involved.</h2>
<h2>Our entry level program will give you all the therapeutic tools you need to be a VERY successful practitioner.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">The Power of Touch Therapy in Massage & Bodywork Is A Basic Human Need</h2>
<h2>The Power Of Touch is not, of course, exclusive to massage therapists. It is a basic human need existing within each of us. All human beings would be well-advised to learn about, understand, and incorporate (non-sexual) touch therapy in their interactions with their close family and even friends.</h2>
<h2>Many people, whether conscious of it or not, are touch deprived. Any kind of human physical contact can be beneficial. This is especially true of infants. It has been shown that their development is significantly improved if they experience more physical touch.</h2>

<h2>Yet a massage therapist is further trained in the Art Of Touch; how to identify and effectively treat numerous indications of need for massage therapy while adhering to high standards of professional ethics and boundaries.</h2>
<h2>In today’s busy society the Element Of Touch is getting lost amongst responsibilities, skepticism and fear; and yet for many people, including in the medical profession, massage therapy is increasingly viewed as “Safe Touch” that can, ideally, bridge the gap between our reservations and requisite for human contact.</h2>
<h2>It is important to realize that human touch does NOT need to incorporate romantic or sexual elements to be useful and effective. In fact, it is often the non-sexual touch that produces more profound results.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Soft Tissue Issues</h2>
<h2>Some of the most frequently sought after massage & bodywork treatments address fatigue, stress, tension, muscle aches and pains, and a wide range of “soft tissue injuries,” all of which can potentially be reduced and/or eliminated through the proper use of professional massage & bodywork techniques and the Power Of Touch.</h2>
<h2>Frankly, we are often amazed at how many health issues are the result of what we call C.E.M.&.N.T. (chronic, excess muscle & nerve tension & stress) in the human body. For example, people experiencing digestive disorders can benefit from manual massage / bodywork therapy applied to the abdomen. Why?</h2>
<h2>Well the intestines within the abdominal cavity are constructed of smooth muscle fibers. They contract and relax too, to produce peristalsis, which pushes food through the small and large intestine. If these muscles build up too much tension and stress, their efficiency is reduced, causing reduction of proper metabolism. This simple basic factor can lead to many other digestive and health problems.</h2>

<h2>Statistics outlining the trends in massage therapy have shown consistent increases in the awareness and acceptance of massage therapy for these and many other needs, including many in the orthodox medical system. More physicians are recommending massage and bodywork to their patients all the time.</h2>

<h2>A Valuable Tool for Balancing Structure</h2>
<h2>Kyle C. Wright, Founder of the SABs, describing anatomy of the shoulder girdle to students.</h2>
<h2>When asking What Is Kinesiology, it can refer to a very specific Science of Posture, Movement & Action. Or it is sometimes called Biomechanics. OR, it can be an entire health or medical profession unto itself with a very wide range of elements. …</h2>
<h2>Let’s explore that a bit …</h2>
<h2>But First, we are NOT here talking about what is commonly called “Applied Kinesiology.” That is a specialized and even esoteric and (in many cases) somewhat paranormal (even supernatural) method of using muscle strength to test for problems such as metabolic, nutritional, or dietary issues.</h2>
<h2>Applied Kinesiology, in general (there are many variations), says there is a “biocomputer” in every Client’s body that can tell the therapist much of what is going on in that body, and sometimes the mind too. It is very often used to diagnose and/or treat various, wide-ranging health & medical issues. …</h2>
<h2>There is a lot of controversy about its validity and accuracy, but that is outside the scope of this discussion.</h2>
<h2>Regardless, such therapists are NOT in these cases using kinesiology to DIRECTLY analyze or evaluate movement or posture as we at the Schools of Advanced Bodywork use it. Although the Applied Kinesiologists could or might be taking those elements into consideration, depending on the Client’s complaints or objectives.</h2>
<h2>Yet that approach to kinesiology is for the most part a completely different study and outside the scope of what is taught at the SABs (Schools of Advanced Bodywork.)</h2>
<h2>The SABs provide a unique approach to kinesiology not found in most massage or bodywork schools. It is central to figuring out how to de-compress, re-balance, & restore to better health a Client’s body. … And in some cases their mind, too.</h2>
<h2>So, referring to a less esoteric meaning of the question of What Is Kinesiology …</h2>
<h2>Wikipedia defines Kinesiology as …</h2>
<h2>Kinesiology (from Ancient Greek κίνησις (kínēsis) ‘movement’, and -λογία -logía ‘study of’) is the scientific study of human body movement. Kinesiology addresses physiological, anatomical, biomechanical, pathological, neuropsychological principles and mechanisms of movement.</h2>
<h2>Applications of kinesiology to human health include biomechanics and orthopedics; strength and conditioning; sport psychology; motor control; skill acquisition and motor learning; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise physiology.</h2>
<h2>Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, electrophysiology of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.</h2>
<h2>~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesiology</h2>
<h2>And as stated in Wikipedia, the word kinesiology itself stems from the Greek word for kinesis, or movement. There can be a lot of potential elements to it, including biomechanics and physics. There are even college or university degrees, some of them requiring years to graduate.</h2>
<h2>Yet for our purposes, it all revolves around the question of how a person stands, moves and takes action, mostly on the level of the physical body & structure.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">SO, for Our Purposes of Massage & Bodywork … What IS Kinesiology?</h2>
<h2>FIG. #1 IMAGE from https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Biceps_brachii_muscle</h2>
<h2>Kinesiology, in brief, is the Science of Movement & Action of the body. …</h2>
<h2>A more specific idea is that kinesiology is the study of how and where bones move when various muscles pull on them. …</h2>
<h2>So in simple kinesiology, for example, when the biceps brachii (in the front of the upper arm) contracts, the forearm is pulled toward the upper arm, bending at the elbow joint. … And the bicep, like most muscles, bulges as it contracts as well.</h2>
<h2>So the biceps brachii acts upon — bending or flexing — the elbow joint. And the more muscle fibers engaged in the action the more strength is generated.</h2>
<h2>The below illustration of bicep brachii and brachioradialis action is from the website of BCCampus (British Columbia/Yukon Open Authoring Platform). Notice that they use the term “Biomechanics” instead of kinesiology in their online textbook. This is not incorrect, as kinesiology is a wide-ranging topic and can be described in many ways.)</h2>
<h2>FIG. #2. Biceps Brachii in a partially flexed position. (Brachioradialis, a “synergist,” also shown.) IMAGE from: https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/humanbiomechanics/wp-content/uploads/sites/972/2020/04/1101_Biceps_Muscle.jpg</h2>
<h2>And just to be a little more expansive in your understanding, and quoting from the Introduction to the BCCampus ebook:</h2>
<h2>Before we go any further, let’s define ‘Biomechanics‘. You can separate the word into two parts: ‘Bio’ which suggests that Biomechanics involves living or biological systems, and ‘Mechanics’ which suggests the analysis of forces and their effects. Biomechanics is the study of structure and function of biological systems by the means of mechanics (Hatze, 1974). The goal of biomechanics related to human movement is to improve physical performance (through improved technique, equipment or training) and injury prevention and rehabilitation.</h2>
<h2>~ https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/humanbiomechanics/</h2>
<h2>(The Schools of Advanced Bodywork teach you everything you need to know to perform our form of musculo-fascial therapy. But if you decide to pursue more in-depth info on the subject, this could be a good place to start.)</h2>
<h2>A TIP on Terminology …</h2>
<h2>By the way, in medical terminology, the “upper arm” is called “the ARM.” The forearm is called the, well, FOREARM. … That’s just in case you’re talking to someone who is well educated in medical terminology and you want to look and sound like a medical professional!</h2>
<h2>On the other hand, if you are mostly talking to Clients or other massage therapists, saying “upper arm” instead of “arm” shouldn’t be a problem. But if you ever find yourself in a highly professional medical environment, using imprecise terminology is frowned upon, and you could lose credibility. (I could tell you some stories!) So, if you want to communicate with certain people, it pays to learn the terminology as best you can.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Basic or Simple vs. Complex Kinesiology</h2>
<h2>So in basic or simple kinesiology, there is the simple, one muscle, one bone interaction. Then there are the more complex kinesiological actions of multiple interactions between more than one muscle and bone. …</h2>
<h2>FIG. #3</h2>
<h2>In a more complex example of “what is kinesiology,” say you want to understand which muscles are pulling a Client’s (or anyone’s) rib cage, chest and head/neck area down and forward. That is a classic slouching posture, like the unhappy guy in the illustration (FIG. #3) on the right …</h2>
<h2>Stemming from a collapsed rib cage, he has a classic forward head/neck posture, a slouch of the torso, and a possibly a “potbelly”! (And if you were looking from the front, he possibly has “love handles,” too!).</h2>
<h2>Too many therapists, and even many physicians, think forward head/neck is from something wrong in the neck. So they try to “fix the neck.” Yet while it is sometimes in the neck, many people have a forward head/neck from a collapsed rib cage, which is from over-shortened abdominal muscles.</h2>
<h2>Of course, a personal or fitness trainer, and many physical therapists (PTs), will say the muscles in the back and back of the neck are “too weak” to hold the head up. So they try to strengthen those muscles. Yet if the problem DOES originate in “too tight” and over-shortened abdominals, the trainer or PT will just make the problem worse.</h2>
<h2>As a well-trained Myo-Structural Bodyworker, you will use kinesiology to determine the difference and are more likely to use the correct treatment strategy.</h2>
<h2>Here is a more precise illustration of how shortened abdominal muscles cause postural imbalances …</h2>
<h2>FIG. #4</h2>
<h2>Do Sit Ups & Crunches Cause Slouched Posture & Back Troubles?</h2>
<h2>FIG. #5</h2>
<h2>Notice that those short abdominal muscles in FIG. #4 above are the SAME muscles that activate to perform Sit Ups or Crunches!</h2>
<h2>So does that mean sit-ups might be a possible CAUSE of slouched posture? Or pot belly and love handles too? … Well, you might be able to see that for yourself from the above illustrations.</h2>
<h2>Digging a Little Deeper …</h2>
<h2>The kinesiological ACTIONS of the muscles pulling DOWN on the rib cage are produced in great part by the three pairs of muscles of the Abdominal Wall, listed below and illustrated to the right (FIG. #5) …</h2>
<h2>• Rectus Abdominus — RA</h2>
<h2>• External Oblique — EO</h2>
<h2>• Internal Oblique — IO</h2>
<h2>In the previous illustration above (FIG. #4 — Muscles Pulling Down & Squeezing …), the abdominal wall muscles are chronically contracted and in an over-shortened state, more or less permanently, if the Client does nothing to resolve the problem.</h2>
<h2>To complicate things, the same muscles, when pulling DOWN on the rib cage, are ALSO pulling UP on the front of the pelvis, which tilts the top of the pelvis rearward (AKA, posterior tilt, SEE Fig. #s 3 & 4). Both actions — ribs coming down and pelvis tipping posteriorly — cause the lower back (lumbar region) to flatten, decreasing the curve of the lumbar (lower back) spine.</h2>
<h2>Sometimes, this becomes a REVERSE curve, which is REALLY troublesome. That is when the lumbar (lower back) vertebrae (spinal joints) are actually pushing out the back of the body!</h2>
<h2>Being part of the CORE of the body, all this can contribute to a wide range of issues in the low back and spinal discs. This postural imbalance can also have far-reaching effects in many other locations of the body up to the skull and down to the feet.</h2>
<h2>So you can start to see this can get much more complex than merely bending your elbow to pick up a glass of water, as in the illustration in Fig. #2. …</h2>
<h2>All of this is Functional Kinesiology.</h2>
<h2>You are observing the relationships between the bones and muscles, and also the functions of how the Client sits, stands and moves in space.</h2>
<h2>And if that bent-over person in above illustration #3 ever wants to stand up straight again, those three pairs of muscles — the Abdominal Wall — must ALL be relaxed & lengthened out again.</h2>
<h2>Not discussed here are the effects of the hip extensors ( the hamstrings [back of thighs] and gluteals [back & sides of hip muscles] ) on the slouched posture. Yet they are VERY involved in posterior tilts of the pelvis. And when the pelvis tilts posteriorly (tilts to the rear), in order to stay balanced in gravity, the pelvis pushes forward in space and the rib cage, neck, & head must move forward and down as well.</h2>
<h2>Then, everything in between gets compressed & dysfunctional.</h2>
<h2>“Abs of Iron … Buns of Steel … BACKS of PAIN!”</h2>
<h2>“And Bad Posture, Too!”</h2>
<h2>~ David Scott Lynn</h2>
<h2>Getting the body back to fully vertical & balanced requires those muscles to be more Relaxed or DE-contracted. And that is where your New Skills of Mindful Medical Massage come into play. And where You will become an EXPERT in providing all that to your Clients.</h2>
<h2>It might all look or sound complicated, but it is simple physics.</h2>
<h2>At the SAB, you’ll study Functional Kinesiology so you can more precisely evaluate which specific muscles are most responsible for a Client or Patient’s pain and/or dysfunction. This provides a more efficient & effective approach to tracking down soft tissue issues* many, if not most, therapists have trouble resolving. …</h2>
<h2>* Soft Tissues: For our purposes, the muscle cells, the fascia, the tendons & ligaments, and the nerves. The visceral organs and glands are soft tissues as well. We can and do have sometimes a profound effect on those, too, yet it is a little less direct.</h2>
<h2>* So, Again, What Is Kinesiology? For Our Purposes, Kinesiology is the Combination of …</h2>
<h2>• Structural Anatomy — Describing the size, shape, and characteristics of the muscles, fascial structures (including tensions and ligaments, and bones & joints.</h2>
<h2>• Functional Kinesiology — Describing what happens to bones & joints and soft tissues when a particular muscle contracts, or multiple muscles contract, moving the body.</h2>
<h2>• Neural Control Systems — The Brain, Central Nervous System, and Peripheral Nerves receive sensory data and send motor instructions to muscles & organs.</h2>
<h2>• Physical Sciences — How external forces such as gravity act upon the body, as well as principles of leverage, structural shapes, hydrostatic (water) pressures in the body, and so on act upon and in the physical body.</h2>
<h2>Your ability to utilize kinesiology also requires a great understanding and knowledge of Structural Anatomy. The SABs specialize in your learning Structural Anatomy & Functional Kinesiology to the extent necessary to be a Specialist in bringing a human body back to more normal alignment and more relaxed function, with greatly reduced tension and stress.</h2>
<h2>And in order to get those muscles to lengthen back out again, you will learn to apply Mindful Medical Massage to help your Clients Learn to FEEL, Relax, Lengthen & Balance the involved muscles.</h2>
<h2>That is the slow, steady, non-intrusive application of manual pressure (or stretching) — sometimes over much longer periods of time on specific muscles than most massage therapists work — to stimulate the nerve endings in the musculo-fascial units such that the central nervous system (CNS) and Brain “RESET” their neurological tension patterns back to a more normal state.</h2>
<h2>The more “normal state” is when musculo-fascial units are more fully relaxed and more able to function to their maximum capacities.</h2>
<h2>Now, just to expand your thinking on What Is Kinesiology, here is how the great Whitney Lowe of the Academy of Clinical Massage defines & describes kinesiology:</h2>
<h2>“Kinesiology is the exploration of human movement and integrates three disciplines: musculoskeletal anatomy (form), neuromuscular physiology (function), and biomechanics. Kinesiology is that area in which these three disciplines intersect. …</h2>
<h2>“Having a good foundation in these clinical sciences as they relate to soft-tissue treatment is a great starting point. By default, understanding kinesiological principles returns a better understanding of human structure and function.”</h2>
<h2>~ https://www.academyofclinicalmassage.com/kinesiology-may-the-force-be-with-you/</h2>
<h2>The beauty, and one of the Great Advantages, of the Schools of Advanced Bodywork, is you do NOT have to go to a year or more of expensive, college-level courses to get a degree in kinesiology, to practice some form of Health- or Medical-focused Kinesiology.</h2>
<h2>You can, in 6 months, at far less cost, learn a high-level skill that includes anatomy & kinesiology, and you can begin helping people right after you graduate!</h2>

<h2>Structural Balancing & Postural Evaluation (or Assessment) are very different, yet closely related processes.</h2>
<h2>There are many different approaches and versions of these processes in massage & bodywork, as well as physical or occupational therapies. We will herein describe the specific process developed, utilized, and taught by Kyle C. Wright’s Schools of Advanced Bodywork.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Structural Balancing:</h2>
<h2>Over-Contracted & Shortened Muscles Pull the Structure Out of Alignment & Down into Force of Gravity</h2>
<h2>Structural Balancing is an Art & Science … While it is based on many sound, time-tested, medically proven principles, there are so many factors operating in the human body it takes some experience to develop the “sense” or “art” of seeing and figuring out what is going on in the human body.</h2>
<h2>The first thing in a therapy session is figuring out what you are going to do. At the Schools of Advanced Bodywork, they do not just show you a bunch of techniques to do and hope they work. This is NOT what is called in the trade a “Poke & Hope” process where you just press on things and hope it helps.</h2>
<h2>You are taught to more precisely track down what the most likely elements of a Client’s soft tissue issues are, determine a proper sequence of which muscles to work and when, then proceed As you proceed, you observe the Clients responses and listen to their feedback, and monitor as to whether you are on the Right Track or not.</h2>
<h2>Even the Best of us do on to always get it right the first time. In the more complex clients, it can be a lot like “detective work.” That’s because there are, in many cases, many possibilities of what could be causing a Client’s issues.</h2>
<h2>Some of that could be because the Client forgets to tell you about a significant accident they had. Or they thought it was so long ago it was not important. …</h2>
<h2>But EVERYTHING is Important!</h2>
<h2>So here is a description of the Elements of what I call BIO-Structural Analysis. The “BIO-” part is because you’re not just examining the tissues in the Client’s body. You are inquiring about many aspects of their health history. … I’ll get to that in a moment.</h2>
<h2>Yet because this work is based on sound, medically researched principles, you have a VERY high success rate at getting to the root cause of what is happening to cause a Client’s complaints, be they pain or dysfunction.</h2>
<h2>The “Medically Proven Principles” are the …</h2>
<h2>• Anatomical Descriptions of the many & various parts of the body.</h2>
<h2>• Rules of How Those Parts Interact with each other to stabilize, protect, and move the body in space.</h2>
<h2>• Neuro-Control Systems, the Brain, Central Nerve System, and Peripheral Nerves that receive sensory information and send out motor control commands to the muscles and organs.</h2>
<h2>• Physical Sciences such as gravitational forces, hydrostatic (water) pressures, how structures work, how & why things “stand up” instead of fall down, and so on.</h2>
<h2>Then we have the Client or Patient Interview …</h2>
<h2>Here, we are delving into the Client’s history, especially any traumatic accidents or injuries they might have had. The body reacts to such events in sometimes VERY strong fashion, and those reactions are often embedded in their Psycho-Neuro-Musculo-Fascial ( PNMF) system.</h2>
<h2>The “psycho-“ part refers only to the fact that the human mind is intimately involved in many of the actions of the body. When you lift a weight or do a sit-up, you are using your mind to volitionally intimate and control the action. So if a former weight lifter overstressed their muscles and is experiencing pain later in life, addressing the “cause” of the pain is more effective and efficient if the mind is engaged in the process of luring how to let go of that tension.</h2>
<h2>Relaxation or DE-Contraction of muscles is far better accomplished if the person is consciously engaging the mind in the process of Feeling & Relaxing their musculo-fascial units. Which as I said, includes the mind and nerves (the PNMF).</h2>
<h2>Their aches & pains, their lost range of motion, their loss of strength & endurance, and loss of balance & coordination, are often the result of hyper-facilitation of that PNMF system.</h2>
<h2>Some people call it “muscle memory,” because it seems “stuck” in the muscles. Yet that memory is really “stored” in the brain, nerve system, and musculo-fascial tissues. Those tissues all work together to retain the protective or stabilizing actions that occurred in the various situations of their lives.</h2>
<h2>Another Factor in the Patient Interview is their “Health History.” This includes all the exercises & stretches they did — or did NOT do — throughout their lives. For example, if a youngster did five years of classical ballet at a long age, then stopped doing it, those patterns of action will most likely stay “stuck” in their PNMF system for LIFE!</h2>
<h2>Same with a football player. The various stresses, strains & impacts upon the body are stored as well, maybe even more so, as there was often more trauma associated with the activity.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">BIO-Structural Analysis</h2>
<h2>It has often been said in orthopedic (medical) and osteopathic (the manual school osteopathy) literature that much of the success in the physical aspects of life has to do with learning how to deal effectively and efficiently with the forces of gravity upon the human body. It is also said, to a lesser extent and less orthodox literature, that much mental and emotional health is at least somewhat dependent on a proper physical relationship to gravity.</h2>
<h2>Muscles on the Left (Client’s Right) are over-shortened relative to Muscles on Right (Client’s Left)</h2>
<h2>One of the many functions of effective bodywork is helping a client discover how to recover this proper and natural relationship which is usually lost early in life, including removing many of the neuromuscular, myofascial and musculoskeletal conditionings and habits that obstruct the operation of the body in the ever present field of gravity.</h2>
<h2>Most little children have great posture and fluid movement, with NO training, by way of natural forces that are built into the body by nature at birth. A lifetime of accumulating tensions, stresses and negative habits interfere with these natural forces. Although some children have lost their unconscious experiment with gravity by a very young age.</h2>
<h2>Although outside the scope of this text, structural analysis refers to the in-depth application of physics and geometry to observing and understanding how structures work; i.e., what makes something stand upright?</h2>
<h2>For example, in the human body, internal forces of muscular pull, leverage of the bones, and hydrostatic pressure interact with the external forces of gravity or other pressures upon the body. The quality of this interaction, in great part, determines our ability to maintain effortless great posture, energetic, fluid movement, and a proper physical and mental attitude.</h2>
<h2>Learning to see these relationships builds the foundation for effective postural assessment.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Postural Evaluation (or Assessment):</h2>
<h2>Postural assessment takes the understanding of these [various] structural forces and applies them to discovering which pulls of muscular tension are distorting or otherwise interfering with posture and movement. There are, in our model, essentially four stages of postural assessment.</h2>
<h2>Understanding Physical Forces such as Vector Lines of Impact & Energy and Repetitive Actions & Stresses experienced by your Clients during day-to-day activities as well as stress, injury & trauma give you Greater, more Relevant Insights into better Treatment Strategies.

<h2>Kyle C. Wright originally learned several of these Groundbreaking Principles & Techniques at a Workshop in Sarasota, Florida in 1993. The workshop was taught by David Scott Lynn, who developed most of these principles in the 1980s.</h2>
<h2>Kyle had recently opened his first massage school in Jacksonville, Florida. He incorporated what he learned from David into his own extensive knowledge and experience of soft tissue therapeutics, and into his personal Therapy Practice and the Core Curriculum of Kyle’s first massage therapy school, the Southeastern School of Neuromuscular & Massage Therapy.</h2>
<h2>Kyle went on to found four more schools thought the Southeast, then sold them in 2007 to Keiser Career Colleges. Before selling the schools, Kyle and his instructors trained in the neighborhood of 12,000 students in these methods.</h2>
<h2>We are borrowing a long page from David’s website describing some of the basic principles of these methods here. David has modified the below text to be more representative of the Schools of Advanced Bodywork in Charlotte NC and Jacksonville, FL.</h2>

<h2>The Methods we teach at the Schools of Advanced Bodywork were rooted in David’s years of practicing & teaching Physical / Mental & Relational Yoga and Postural Yoga Therapy. Going beyond “Conscious Stretching” into therapeutic, David became a bodyworker, and developed his own methods of Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy & Myo-Structural Bodywork …</h2>
<h2>Combined with Kyle’s extensive clinical experience and wide range of trainings in various modalities, you now have access to a Soft Tissue Educational System covering a wide-range of challenges most Clients present with.</h2>
<h2>Our focus, while applicable to nearly any of a Clients needs, we are primary focus on Clients who have very complex, long-term soft tissue issues that have been unresponsive to other therapies. Our students have a very high track record of successes with Clients who had nearly given up on ever finding relief or correction of their neuromuscular, myofascial, and musculoskeletal issues.</h2>

<h2>DSL EdgeWork is a comprehensive, integrated system of principles, practices & preventive therapeutics with a strong scientific & philosophical basis. As a therapeutic system, it has very often found and resolved sources of a wide variety of musculoskeletal, neuromuscular and myofascial issues other practitioners and physicians, using a wide range of orthodox or alternative modalities, had given up on.</h2>

<h2>The Primary Purpose & Focus of DSL EdgeWork was originally to find and relieve chronic, excess muscle & nerve tension & stress (or C.E.M.&.N.T. for short because for some people, that’s what their muscles feel like) through a “Conscious Stretching” practice. Then, based on many principles & techniques he learned from a man named Joel Kramer. Joel was considered a leader in the field of physical & mental yoga and produced a number of innovations in the practice.</h2>
<h2>After several years as a yoga teacher, and moving toward therapeutic practice, David became a massage / bodywork practitioner in 1981. This was after several years of working informally with some of the leading muscle therapists in America.</h2>
<h2>David’s system of advanced yoga therapy and myo-structural bodywork (mindful medical massage therapy) dissolves C.E.M.&.N.T. more thoroughly than most systems we are aware of. We will explain much of that in a moment.</h2>
<h2>Many aches and pains, afflictions and dysfunctions of the body have their roots in this excess muscle tension, yet it goes to a great degree unacknowledged, sometimes unnoticed. Even many massage therapists, bodyworkers and yoga teachers, those you would expect to know, are unaware of just how significant C.E.M.&.N.T. is in the many specific as well as overall issues of life, nor really what to do about it.</h2>
<h2>With DSL EdgeWork, and the teachings of the Schools of Advanced Bodywork, overall neuromuscular and myofascial tension, physical and mental stress, and negative habit patterns are directly addressed, reduced, and if possible, eliminated by the soft tissue techniques, the Primary Tools employed.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">The Primary Tools of DSL EdgeWork Are …</h2>
<h2>… the EdgeTouch™ Manual Technique: Mindful, Medical Massage — hands-on, manual pressure (similar to “regular” massage, with significant nuances and differences) and DSL’s unique system of …</h2>
<h2>… Let-Go Yoga: Learning How to GET CONTROL of muscles, nerves, fascia & joints by LETTING GO of tension, stress and negative habit patterns with Modern Postural Yoga (Conscious Stretching).</h2>
<h2>HOWEVER, the word YOGA means, according to Joel Kramer, “the quality of attention you are paying to whatever it is you are doing.” Meaning the hands on massage or bodywork technique is in itself a “yogic” practice. So you don’t have to do physical yoga postures (although that’s not a bad idea!).</h2>
<h2>In fact, when David first began developing his bodywork principles & techniques, he designed the manual massage & bodywork techniques to be an “externally applied form of physical & mental yoga.”</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Getting Mind & Body Working Together</h2>
<h2>Bodywork, medical massage therapy and such tools operate under David’s principles of Psycho-Muscular Release (short for Psycho-Neuro-Musculo-Fascial Release) dealing with relaxing musculo-fascial tensions, physical, mental & emotional stresses, negative habitual tension patterns and other metabolic restrictions (such as “gluing” in the fascia) in the psycho-muscular system.</h2>
<h2>Psycho-Muscular Release is achieved with (optionally) Let-Go Yoga and Yoga-Based, hands-on Myo-Structural Bodywork. Both tools follow the basic rules of paying close attention to the sensation and movement of the body while Playing the Edge of Pain, Fear & Resistance.</h2>
<h2>This means No Pain, MORE Gain!</h2>
<h2>As already mentioned, much of the DSL system is derived from the pioneering teachings of Joel Kramer. DSL began applying Joel’s principles to massage and bodywork in the late 1970s and has been developing and refining them ever since. One of Joel’s primary teachings was going up TO but not into pain, up TO the edge but not over it.</h2>
<h2>That is NOT how much the Client can TOLERATE. It is what they LIKE, or are perfectly NEUTRAL about.</h2>
<h2>Rather than the Client being a more-or-less passive recipient of the work, a EdgeWork trained practitioner, whether using hands-on work or stretching, or both, strives to more fully engage or involve the Client’s MIND directly in the tension release process.</h2>
<h2>This is about Participatory Health Care, not Spectator health care.</h2>
<h2>The first level of this is to establish a communication system where Client keeps the Therapist well informed, in as close to Real Time as possible, as to what they’re feeling & experiencing. This is especially important relative to their sensation or pain levels.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">NO Pain Means MORE Gain</h2>
<h2>Again (and this cannot be emphasized too much) whether receiving medical massage therapy, myo-structural bodywork, or structural yoga therapy (conscious stretching), the Client should always LIKE or be completely NEUTRAL about what they’re feeling. They should not be tolerating any sensations. (A so-called Good Hurt is not really a hurt or pain in the strict sense of the word. It may be a moderate to very intense yet pleasurable or emotionally neutral sensation.)</h2>
<h2>Put another way, the Client should, ideally, be inviting the sensations, not fighting or resisting. The old No Pain, NO Gain philosophy might work well enough in professional football or boxing, but does not work very well in therapeutic endeavors or tension release practices.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Minimum to Maximum Edges of Sensation</h2>
<h2>In fact, in most cases, the more acute or chronic trauma, stress or injury a Client presents with, the less pressure or stretch is initially applied to the involved myofascial units to prevent negative reactions, many of which are non-conscious and can go unnoticed by an insufficiently trained therapist or even the Client.</h2>
<h2>This approach is about working toward the Minimum Edges, the lower, sometimes MUCH lower, levels of intensity of sensation. This is an application of the Low- or Micro-Dose principles of Homeopathic Medicine. (See Special Note below on the words Medicine and Homeopathy.)</h2>
<h2>A very healthy Client can work with, or closer to, their Maximum Edges, higher levels of intensity, as long as they invest some time in working with or near their Minimum Edges, to most efficiently and effectively Let-Go of their inevitably accumulated tensions & stresses, at a fundamental level, on a regular basis.</h2>
<h2>Letting Go of Tension, rather than forcing it, is an element of Volitional Release, where you are intentionally looking for ways to release tension by consciously relaxing.</h2>
<h2>More typical approaches to hands-on bodywork and yoga therapy give the impression that tension is “pushed out” by the therapists finger or hand pressure, or “pulled out” by stretching as if tension were a “thing” that needed to be removed. That model of therapy often leads to much more aggressive work, usually pushing the Client over their Edge, very often causing negative reactions.</h2>
<h2>Such aggressive work can in many cases help matters quite a lot, despite the pain or discomfort. Yet with more traumatized, or long-standing, chronic tensions, or tissue injuries, Less Really Can Be More.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">SPECIAL NOTE: The term Client, as used in the DSL Method of Yoga / Bodywork / Whole Health Therapeutics</h2>
<h2>One who is under the protection of another. (From Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary.)</h2>
<h2>This way of defining a Client implies a higher level of relationship and responsibility on the part of the Physician, Therapist, Trainer or Coach than is ordinarily observed. Compare with the term Patient:</h2>
<h2>1. an individual awaiting or under medical care and treatment.</h2>
<h2>2. the recipient of any of various personal services.</h2>
<h2>3. one that is acted upon.</h2>
<h2>The implied attitudinal difference toward the Client versus the Patient should be obvious. The term Client, as we described, is found in the Merriam-Webster’s Medical Dictionary. The otherwise very progressive Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary defines a Client as merely: The patient of a healthcare professional.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Steady, Specific Manual Pressure Minimal Lateral Movement</h2>
<h2>Generally speaking, our muscle realist technique is generally minimal movement as far as lateral movement goes. WE do very little or no cross fiber, WE do not glide the length of the muscle fibers.</h2>
<h2>We find a “tight spot” in the muscle and hold steady pressure on that specific spot and allow the nervous system to produce the relaxation response we are looking for.</h2>
<h2>Our focus is NOT primarily on “treating the muscle.” A muscle is held tight or hyper-active by nerves sending motor signals to the muscle (or organ) which initiate and maintain contraction. As long as that nerve activity is too high, the muscle cannot relax, the organ can ont calm down.</h2>
<h2>In a Passive Stretch, the Muscle Fibers are Stimulated by “Pulling on the Ends” at the tendons. With Manual Work, the Muscle Fibers are Stimulated by Pressing in the Middle of the Muscle Belly.</h2>
<h2>We apply pressure to the muscle fibers in order to stimulate certain nerve endings in the muscles. That sensory stimulus sends specific, non-invasive “signals” into the central nervous system (CNS) and brain. Then, if the brain is not perceiving intrusions or danger, the brain and CNS will begin “resetting” the degree of nerve firing. Done properly, the nerve firing is rest to a lower level of activity, reducing how many motor nerve impulses are sent to the muscle or organ.</h2>
<h2>When we press into the muscle belly, that= that stimulates the Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) where the muscles meet the tendons. That sends signals to the Central Nerve System. As long as there is no protective action stimulated, the CNS then turns off motor signals to the Muscle Belly, allowing the muscle to relax.</h2>
<h2>As the number and frequency of nerve impulses decreases, the muscle or organ begins to relax. And generally speaking, LESS manual pressure on the muscle works better than MORE pressure.</h2>
<h2>As the muscle relaxes, our fingers or hands will sink into the muscle as it softens. Our job is NOT to “PUSH” the release, but to FOLLOW the release of tension. We might be “adding energy” to the relaxation process, but we are NOT forcing the process.</h2>
<h2>Muscles are highly sensitive, and very responsive, and it is very easy to trigger negative reactions. Often times, the Client or Therapist will not even feel or notice those reactions. Yet to get the MOST out of the “tension reset process,” we want to have the least amount of negative reactions.</h2>
<h2>What we just described is very often the hardest thing for a Therapist to learn and apply. It is almost programmed into our systems to push harder when the muscle starts to give. Or if it does NOT give, we push even harder! Therefore it takes a high degree of conscious attention on the part of the therapist to monitor what’s happening in the Client’s tissues, and in the Therapists own body.</h2>
<h2>I often point out that the problem with a lot of therapy training (such as in massage school) is the Student is taught to Deliver a Technique to the Client’s body. As a result, they are more focused on their own activity, rather than the Client’s body. … Yet the best use of any “technique,” whatever it is, is as a method of FEELING what is happening in the Clients’ soft tissues. … It is that sensitivity to the changes in the Clients tissues that the Real Action happens. But that is something difficult to understand until you’ve had some experience.</h2>
<h2>~ David Scott Lynn</h2>
<h2>So, we’ve discussed HOW to work with a Client’s soft tissues. Now, we’ll discuss WHERE to work.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Myo-Structural Balancing: DE-Compressing & Aligning the Human Structure</h2>
<h2>Decisions on which myofascial units to work on and when, and in what sequence, are made with DSL’s system of Myo-Structural Balancing. The system includes:</h2>
<h2>* BIO-Structural Analysis: Study of the physical structures & mental & metabolic forces of the human body. (BIO refers to the many factors beyond just the physical posture.)</h2>
<h2>* Postural Assessment: Using the alignment or misalignment of the bone structure to determine what muscular tension patterns are interfering with proper posture and function.</h2>
<h2>* Myo-Structural Balancing Strategies: Determining the sequence in which to release tension patterns.</h2>
<h2>The BIO-Structural Sciences employed are:</h2>
<h2>* Advanced Structural Anatomy: Detailed location and dimensions of the various parts of the body</h2>
<h2>* Postural & Functional Kinesiology: How those parts interact with each other</h2>
<h2>* Physics & Geometry of Structures: Natural Forces acting upon and within the body</h2>
<h2>* Neuromuscular / Myofascial Physiology: How the systems work internally</h2>
<h2>* Neuro-Logical Physiology: Body-Brain-Mind Integration, especially Sensory-Motor feedback</h2>
<h2>* Dynamics of the Psycho-Neuro-Musculo-Fascial System: Putting it all together</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">The Psycho-Neuro-Musculo-Fascial System in Myo-Structural Bodywork & Balancing</h2>
<h2>The term BIO-Structural Bodywork is a general term including musculoskeletal, psycho-muscular, neuromuscular, myofascial and other bodywork systems and principles, yet implying a system applicable in a wide range of potential situations.</h2>
<h2>We developed our system of bodywork / massage / yoga therapy with these principles in mind:</h2>
<h2>The prefix BIO- is short for a wholistic approach to analyzing the bodymind.</h2>
<h2>Biologic (meaning Living) and Bioenergetic (referring to the interaction of mental, emotional and physical aspects) … Integral (all things working together at a deeper, more complete level), and … Organon and Optimal (the body of knowledge utilized to achieve the optimized results of Myo-Structural Balancing).</h2>
<h2>The prefix MYO- reminds us that it is the musculo-fascial system, acting as one synergistic system, that holds and moves the body. And of course, the nerves tell the muscle(s) what to do or not do.</h2>
<h2>As utilized in The DSL Method, it is, potentially, a more preventive & integrative system, a generalized approach to working with and normalizing the whole human structure toward a more harmonized and integrated function.</h2>
<h2>Rather than being about tracking down specific symptoms or illnesses, aches or pains, or dysfunctions, the whole structure is assessed for its long-term accumulations of muscular tension and stress. We’re looking to more accurately find: psycho-neuro-musculo-fascial tensions that have been and are pulling the overall structure out of proper balance. Within that overall structure, localized imbalances occur as well.</h2>
<h2>For Example, after detailed discussions with a Client, we might discover they had an accident many years, even decades ago, but they thought, or they were told, something that long ago could not be the problem. We, on the other hand, understand that once a particular protective or compensatory pattern of action is integrated into the bodymind, it will often NOT “let go” until it is addressed properly.</h2>
<h2>These patterns of action lead to imbalances, in turn causing inefficiencies of movement and action and increase of physical tensions and stresses interfering with various functions in day-to-day life.</h2>
<h2>One common error is to assume the imbalances or postural distortions themselves causing pain. Yet we sometimes must use the opposite idea. It is more or most often the C.E.M.&.N.T. (Chronic, Excess Muscle & Nerve Tension & Stress) causing the imbalances. Attempting to push bones or fascia back into place, or realign the joints, or get more flexible, is not our objective. Those are by-products.</h2>
<h2>Our main objective is to use structural analysis / postural assessment to tell us which musculoskeletal-facial units are must hyper-contracted. When they are released, the human structure very often just goes back to “normal” without having to “push it into place.”</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Gravity is NOT the Enemy</h2>
<h2>The primary focus of the work is Structural De-Compression and Balancing the Body Structures in the field of gravity. By releasing tensions that are compressing and interfering with proper function of the body, hands-on work brings the body back to balance.</h2>
<h2>Natural Forces built into the body by nature, at birth, are restored to proper or full function, providing the body with effortless good posture; energetic, fluid movement; and a pain-free existence.</h2>
<h2>The term Clinical Massage (or Bodywork) Therapy is a more specifically targeted system designed to track down and resolve discrete pain patterns and can work in a more targeted, specific way. It is directly targeted toward immediate resolution of very specific pains and dysfunction.</h2>
<h2>Yet it is quite often the case that if the more global approach of Myo-Structural Bodywork is applied, many, and sometimes all, of the specific issues will clear up on their own without “chasing the pain.” The choice of which two approaches to use, although there is much overlap, depends upon the goals and objectives of the Individual Client.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">SPECIAL NOTE: Historically, especially in modern, orthodox medicine</h2>
<h2>The term structure has tended to imply (although not by strict dictionary definition) JUST the bones and joints of the body, ignoring the part muscle play in just about everything. This can lead to significant blind spots toward the importance of muscles and fascial sheaths in many conditions, especially postural issues such as functional scoliosis. (Orthodox medicine, especially Orthopedics, generally does not consider scoliosis to be a “postural” problem.) Since the advent of Rolfing® (Structural Integration) and Classical Osteopathy before that, the term structural has been more widely used to imply the entire musculoskeletal and fascial system.</h2>
<h2>From Merriam-Websters:</h2>
<h2>Structure: The aggregate of elements of an entity in their relationships to each other.</h2>
<h2>* Rolfing® is one of the grand parents, and probably best known, of the forerunners of modern structurally oriented approaches to musculoskeletal issues. [Osteopathy is much older, yet generally does not pay as much attention to the soft tissues as do the more recent iterations of structural therapy, such as Rolfing. Modern Naturopathic Medicine embraces soft tissue and manual medicine to increasing degrees as well.]</h2>
<h2>With Rolfing® the focus was put on soft tissue as the primary force affecting the structure. However, Rolfing put most of their focus on the fascial, connective tissues, and much less on the muscles. The DSL Method considers>this near exclusive focus on fascia to be a substantial error, especially when considering the well-established sciences behind the issues. The primary difference is fascia has minimal capacity to “contract” to anywhere near the degree, if at all, that muscle fibers do.</h2>
<h2>While muscle can shorten up to 150% of their resting length, most fascial & ligament structures have about a 4 to 7% of extensibility. Meaning they can only change length about 4 to 7% without strain, sprain, or tearing of the tissues.</h2>
<h2>The primary focus of BIO-Structural Balancing is on learning to observe the various physical structures and forces within the human body — which can even include how a person thinks — and how they relate to gravity and other external pressures and forces, as well as internal, psycho-emotional forces.</h2>
<h2>Then, Psycho-Muscular Release is employed via the EdgeTouch™ Manual Technique or Let-Go Yoga to relax the muscular tensions that distort posture and function and interfere with movement and action.</h2>

<h2>The DSL EdgeWork, Hands-On Bodywork System is based solidly on basic principles and insights of physical, mental & relational yoga as well as perspectives, principles & sciences from myofascial, neuromuscular & structural bodywork. (Yet there are many VERY significant differences and some controversies in philosophy, principles, & techniques between the DSL Method and the more commonly known bodywork and yoga systems.)</h2>
<h2>The basic DSL Let-Go Yoga principles are derived primarily from Joel Kramer, whom many people call the Father of American Yoga and the First American Yoga Master.</h2>
<h2>The Let-Go Yoga System has, in turn, been extensively modified by many years (beginning in 1981) of professional experience in private sessions of hands-on bodywork & therapeutic yoga, and extensive cross-training working with physicians and practitioners of a wide range of orthodox and wholistic medicine/natural healthcare modalities.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">SPECIAL NOTE: On the word Medicine and the Big Picture of Yoga in Eastern & Western Thought</h2>
<h2>The DSL Method takes a yogic* attitude toward the practice of “medicine.” As described by David Bohm in his 1983 book Wholeness and the Implicate Order*, the word medicine is derived from the Latin root mederi, which translates into to measure, to moderate, to mediate, to meditate … and also medicine.</h2>
<h2>All of these are also the root of the term to cure.</h2>
<h2>As Bohm states:</h2>
<h2>” … ‘to cure’ is based on a root meaning ‘to measure’. This reflects the view that physical health is to be regarded as the outcome of a state of right inward measure in all parts and processes of the body. … the word moderation, which describes one of the prime ancient notions of virtue, is based on the same root, and this shows that such virtue was regarded as the outcome of a right inner measure underlying man’s social actions and behavior. Again, the word meditation, which is based on the same root, implies a kind of weighing, pondering, or measuring of the whole process of thought, sensing, feeling and being, which could bring the inner activities of the mind to a state of harmonious measure.”</h2>
<h2>The larger point Bohm was making is that medicine, in ancient times, was more about an Inner Measure, a more internally meditative, self-aware function. Yet in modern times, medicine is more about external measuring devices (blood pressure cuffs, MRIs, X-rays, EKGs, etc.) and our inner, meditative, more wholistic* sense of ourselves is often completely over-run or altogether missing from the modern medical “measure.”</h2>
<h2>This is not to say the modern, outer measure approach is of no value or use. It is immensely valuable for certain processes and needs. It is only to say that it has lost much in the transition … and the translation!</h2>
<h2>* Wholistic is here written with a *W* rather than as in holistic. To some, the word holistic implies the terms “holy” and/or “holographic,” interpretations the DSL approach does not fully subscribe to in such cases.</h2>
<h2>Physical/Mental & Relational Yoga is an Inner Measuring of a subjective sense of self, which includes how we relate to other human beings and our environment, with an objective of Optimal Internal and External Health:</h2>
<h2>Therefore, IF one ascribes to the term Yoga the meaning Awareness in the Inner Measure or meditative sense, then we see this ancient derivative of the root word mederi as the foundation of real medicine in a fuller, deeper, more humanistic and less mechanical way. We also see an ancient root meaning opening doors to yoga and medicine as a physical, mental & relational system.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">On the Term *DSL*</h2>
<h2>The acronym DSL is, on one hand, the initials of David Scott Lynn. … On the other hand, David wrote a small book titled DSL: The Dynamics of (BIO)-Structural Learning©.</h2>
<h2>Dynamics: The Physical, Intellectual, and Moral (!!!) forces producing motion, activity, and change in a given sphere.</h2>
<h2>(See Century Dictionary & Cyclopedia, 1911 edition. That definition could be considered “out-of-date,” just as my use of the word medicine could be considered out-of-date. However, it figures perfectly in a more wholistic view of the sciences of being human.)</h2>
<h2>DSL EdgeWork studies a wide range of the Dynamics of Being Human. You can learn to more fully study and experience your internal physical and mental dynamics via your own human structure, powers of observation, and Beingness, a process called phenomenology. In short, how objective can you BE in your subjectivity?</h2>
<h2>Physical, Mental & Relational Yoga, as well as Yoga-based, Hands-on Bodywork, are excellent systems by which to study those inner dynamics. We also recognize that while more often than not the function of a mechanism or entity follows or is determined by its structure or form, there are also times when the function significantly influences or modifies the structure.</h2>
<h2>BIO-Structural: The interrelation of parts or the principle of organization in a complex, living unity.</h2>
<h2>Having to do with the psychological, emotional, metabolic (organs) and neurological elements, as well as the muscular, skeletal and fascial components, which drive and/or participate in, and are reflected in, one’s overall structure, posture, function, digestion & elimination, mobility and the creation of Purposeful Action.</h2>
<h2>Learning: To cause to understand, to lead someone on his or her way, to lead out.</h2>
<h2>In its more profound sense, real learning is NOT just data accumulation, rote memorization, or behavior modification, although it can include those to varying degrees. Real Learning is about developing a capacity to See Anew, to FEEL Reality, to integrate Reality into One’s Self, and vice versa.</h2>

<h2>As Joel Kramer has said, one of the many things yoga is, is a way of learning. To that effect, real discipline is not about a militaristic conformity to a system or a norm. … A disciple is one who learns, who is deeply interested in, is committed to going to the depths of what a subject or object has to teach us or that we can master.</h2>

<h2>Kyle Wright is the founder and President of the North Carolina School of Advanced Bodywork, Inc. It was originally located in the quaint town of Fairview, North Carolina; a suburb just ten minutes southeast of Asheville, North Carolina. He moved the school to Charlotte in ????.</h2>
<h2>Kyle graduated in 1984 from the Suncoast School of Massage Therapy, Inc., located in Tampa, Florida. He was certified by Paul St. John in neuromuscular therapy in 1985 and had the privilege of learning and assisting Paul St John, LMT and Judith Walker, LMT in their development of their post-graduate educational seminars. He assisted them nationally in the field of Neuromuscular Therapy from 1986 through 1991 while maintaining his practice at the Jacksonville Neurological Clinic for 6 years.</h2>
<h2>Further, Kyle went on to work at the North Florida Center for Head, Neck and TMJ assisting the physician’s patients by normalizing the soft tissue components of the body, thus reducing many of the afflictions associated with temporomandibular disorders.</h2>
<h2>His new school’s curriculum and health care facility is devoted to the treatment and on-going clinical research of postural related problems, muscular imbalances and myofascial pain.</h2>
<h2>As the primary hands-on instructor of functional anatomy, kinesiology, soft tissue pathology and clinical treatment strategies, Kyle also maintains a full-time practice at The Wright Center in Fairview, NC, near Asheville, and offers regular continuing educational seminars as a “category A” provider for the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork. He teaches a multitude of post graduate training courses to further educate licensed therapists in the evaluation and treatment protocols for soft tissue injuries.</h2>
<h2>Kyle’s curriculum for the North Carolina Schools of Advanced Bodywork, now in Charlotte, North Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida,  was initially developed in 1991, when he co-founded his first of five Southeastern Schools of Neuromuscular and Massage Therapy, Inc. located in Jacksonville, Florida. There he developed the clinical and practical portion of the neuromuscular and structural bodywork curriculum.</h2>
<h2>Kyle has written and self-published the manual, Clinical Neuromuscular and Structural Bodywork, which served his former students of the Southeastern Schools for the past 17 years.</h2>
<h2>He also went on to co-found the Southeastern Schools of Neuromuscular and Massage Therapy, Inc. in Charlotte, North Carolina as well as Greenville, Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina.</h2>
<h2>In 2005; two of his schools were awarded with School of Distinction Awards by the Accrediting Commission for Career Schools and Colleges of Technology (ACCSCT).</h2>
<h2>In 2007, after selling the Southeastern schools to Keiser University and two Wright Centers of Advanced Bodywork practices to his loyal and long-standing therapists of twenty years, Kyle shifted his energy to fulfill his dream of living and operating his new school, the original School of Advanced Bodywork in the health and wellness minded area of Western North Carolina, in Fairview.</h2>
<h2>For the past 25 years Kyle’s commitment to the field of bodywork has helped further his studies working with in conjunction with many physicians specializing in neurology, orthopedics, podiatry, radiology, chiropractic, and dentistry. He has also worked with many of the industry greats in athletic training, physical therapy and many nationally renowned massage therapists.</h2>
<h2>He served as an instructor on the teaching rotation of the Complimentary/Alternative Medicine (CAM) curriculum at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida. There he taught proper posture, myofascial imbalances and their relationship to musculoskeletal pain.</h2>
<h2>Kyle maintains a unique relationship with many of the worlds’s top Professional Golfers playing on the PGA and European Tour. When traveling and working with the players, his treatment strategies — in conjunction with his unique method of hands-on, Myo-Structural Therapy — include cardio training, light work-outs, and stretching 3 hours before their tee times. The massage and bodywork in the evenings enhances their peek performance.</h2>
<h2>Kyle was honored to be selected as Massage Therapist of the Year by the Florida State Massage Therapy Association in the North Florida Chapter in 1992.</h2>

<h2>What ARE the differences between massage and bodywork? Our Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy School teaches you the full spectrum of techniques so you can work in the professional environment you prefer.</h2>
<h2>Most massage therapists practice one or more forms of massage that are very relaxing and healthful, yet general in nature. While modalities like Swedish Massage and Asian Bodywork are very useful and valuable in many settings, there is a difference.</h2>
<h2>NCSAB is primarily a CLINICAL / Medical Massage Therapy School. Our main focus is on you becoming a clinical, soft tissue specialist in managing and resolving significant pain, posture, movement, and dysfunction issues for which many people have not found relief.</h2>
<h2>YET, in addition to our Leading Edge Medical Massage Therapy Training, you’ll receive an excellent education in the skills of Swedish Massage, the more relaxing type of full body massage with oils and all that. This is all great and useful stuff, especially if you want to work in a spa setting or a franchise massage center.</h2>
<h2>Full-body Swedish Massage might well be the original basis for most massage in America. Our highly accomplished Swedish Massage Instructor will provide you with top-of-the line education in full body, therapeutic massage. You’ll be very skilled in these modalities when you finish your program.</h2>
<h2>Yet upon graduating, you’ll have more to offer … much more! … And you’ll learn the differences between massage and bodywork, and when to use one or the other, or a combination of the two.</h2>
<h2>Our Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy & Myo-Structural Bodywork training are very different therapeutic disciplines compared to Swedish and other Asian or “Energy” related therapies. We are primarily focused on Western, science-based and medical approaches for the millions of people suffering from acute and chronic pain, injury and trauma related issues.</h2>
<h2>We also provide you with skills for achieving optimum physical performance for clients such as athletes, construction workers and others who use their bodies in their work or other activities on a frequent or daily basis.</h2>
<h2>One example is the dental hygienist who’s sitting in a twisted and distorted body posture under high levels of stress, for many hours every day. Such work produces many muscular imbalances, in turn creating various aches, pains and other dysfunction.</h2>
<h2>Or musicians who don’t necessarily have very high levels of physical stress to their muscles in short bursts, but do many thousands or millions of smaller, even tiny, movements that accumulate over time. That can add up to injuries similar to athletic injuries.</h2>
<h2>And those who are not in pain, yet want better posture, movement, balance and coordination, will be amazed at the results you produce. There is also an entire market in corporate and industrial America for working with clients who must sit in front of computers or run machinery all day long, suffering from poor posture and repetitive strain injuries.</h2>
<h2>Our Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy School provides you the ability to understand and effectively identify and manipulate the soft tissues of the body for the purpose of reducing chronic, excess muscle and nerve tension and stress, contributing to the onset of pain and dysfunction.</h2>
<h2>This field of study offers an in-depth look at the various causes, symptoms and conditions of muscle tension and the principles to reverse that tension and stress.</h2>
<h2>Myo-Structural Bodywork scientifically tracks down the aches, pains, and dysfunctions not sufficiently responsive to the usual localized treatment (at the location of symptoms) of neuromuscular and myofascial structures. Then you’ll use the Myo-Structural Bodywork Release Techniques to reduce or eliminate tension in the Client’s musculoskeletal-fascial units.</h2>
<h2>When you add the scientific elements of clinical / medical massage therapy and myo-structural bodywork to our No Pain, More Gain “Edge” Technique and Structural Analysis Strategies, you’ll get the most results in the widest range of myofascial and neuro-structural syndromes. And though Western in nature, we believe, our approach is a no less of a “conscious” system than some of the more esoteric modalities out there.</h2>
<h2>These elements will be a primary focus of your training, including the important differences between massage and bodywork, and upon graduation from NCSAB, you’ll be prepared for private practice or employment in many settings.</h2>

<h2>Your Clinical / Medical Massage Career in Charlotte, NC, starts at the North Carolina School of Advanced Bodywork (NCSAB) …</h2>
<h2>YOU TOO can become a professional Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy Specialist …</h2>
<h2>and be highly trained in resolving neuromuscular, musculo-fascial, and musculoskeletal issues with our method of Myo-Structural Bodywork & Balancing.</h2>
<h2>At The Schools of Advanced Bodywork (in Charlotte, NC, and Jacksonville, FL), you’ll become part of an elite group of bodywork professionals. …</h2>
<h2>You owe it to yourself to pursue a career you’ll love!</h2>
<h2>The power of touch is not exclusive to massage therapists. It is a basic human need existing within each of us. A massage therapist is trained in the art of touch—how to identify and effectively treat the numerous indications for massage therapy while adhering to high standards of professional ethics and boundaries.</h2>
<h2>In today’s busy society, the element of touch is getting lost amidst responsibilities, skepticism, and fear; yet massage therapy is viewed as a “safe touch” that can bridge the gap between our reservations and the need for human contact.</h2>
<h2>Some of the most frequently sought-after treatments address fatigue, stress, tension, muscle aches, pains, dysfunction, and soft tissue injuries, all of which can, in many cases, be reduced and eliminated through the proper use of professional massage techniques. Statistics outlining the trend in massage therapy have shown a consistent increase in the awareness and acceptance of massage therapy.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">A Serious Education for Those Serious About Their Future!</h2>
<h2>Is a Medical Massage Therapy Career Viable Today?</h2>
<h2>The field of massage continues to grow and strengthen into an increasingly effective and sought-after form of therapy and an ever-increasing alternative to Western medicine. In fact, it’s been a very effective and efficient way to heal many musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, and musculo-fascial issues for decades. Yet it is only now becoming more recognized for its capacity to reduce or resolve so many “soft tissue issues.”</h2>
<h2>That recognition is coming from both grassroots consumers—the clients and patients—as well as the medical professions.</h2>
<h2>A career in massage therapy affords a flexible schedule as well as a wide range of avenues in which to practice. The standards by which all licensed massage and bodywork therapists adhere promote continual advancements within the field of massage therapy.</h2>
<h2>Now is a great time to jump into the field of massage therapy; class sizes are small, the program can be completed in just six months, and it is a very reasonable investment for your future.</h2>
<h2>Our highly specialized, medically therapeutic curriculum focuses on giving you the full range of clinical tools you need to be among the best leading-edge therapists in the industry, able to work effectively and efficiently with the most challenging clients.</h2>
<h2>With a track record of 100% pass rates on national exams, we will, in six or twelve months, prepare you for a highly rewarding, lifelong career helping people resolve their musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction, restoring them to a better life in the process.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Your Primary Focus In Medical Massage Will Be On …</h2>
<h2>The soft tissues of the human body—directly on the muscles, fascia, tendons, and ligaments, and to a lesser degree and indirectly the organs, nerves, and vessels—comprise a vast portion of the myo-structural body.</h2>
<h2>And the muscular components—with their ability to produce a substantial degree of contraction, shortening, hardening, dehydration, and irritation of nerves—can exert many forces upon other soft tissues, joints, and bones, producing many tensions, stresses, and pathologies in the body.</h2>
<h2>We find relaxation and reduction of C.E.M.&.N.T. (Chronic, Excess Muscle & Nerve Tension & Stress) to be a valuable key to reducing or eliminating many of the tensions and stresses producing so many conditions and pathologies in the body. Relaxation of muscle cells reduces tensions and stresses on a wide range of tissues in the body.</h2>
<h2>You’ll become an expert at facilitating your clients in learning to feel, relax, lengthen, and balance those overly tense musculo-fascial units causing so many problems for so many people.</h2>
<h2>Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy is seen by many clients, patients, and physicians as an ever-expanding alternative to Western medicine. Increasing numbers of Western-trained physicians are turning to various forms of massage therapy to help their patients with a wide range of “soft tissue issues.”</h2>
<h2>PLEASE SEE an Historical View of the Word MEDICINE HERE</h2>
<h2>In-depth, superior education in clinically oriented, medical massage therapy techniques puts our graduates at the top of the list for those wanting a career working with such physicians. More physicians are seeking out clinically and medically trained massage therapists who understand the role of soft tissue dysfunction and musculoskeletal pathologies. Many healthcare specialists in the field of pain management seek out our NCSAB graduates (and our sister school, FLSAB) because of the clinically focused, advanced training they receive.</h2>
<h2>FACT: Our first two graduates at the new FLSAB in 2016 were employed by two neurology groups.</h2>
<h2>Your medical massage therapy career affords you a flexible schedule as well as a wide range of avenues in which to practice.</h2>
<h2>Now is a great time to enter a massage therapy career. Our class sizes are small, the program can be completed in just 6 months full-time or 12 months part-time, and it is, in many ways, a very reasonable, even excellent, yet rewarding investment for your future.</h2>

<h2>One common choice of graduates is to develop a self-employed private practice. With the right training in skills and knowledge, plus your personal motivation to get the word out to potential clients, this option affords you:</h2>
<h2>* Setting your own hours</h2>
<h2>* High career satisfaction</h2>
<h2>* Helping people—your clients—on a daily basis</h2>
<h2>* Contributing to society</h2>
<h2>* Low-stress environment</h2>
<h2>* Choosing who you want to work with as clients</h2>
<h2>* Designing your life the way you want it</h2>
<h2>Alternatively, in your personalized medical massage therapy career, you can work in a wide range of employment opportunities:</h2>
<h2>* With physicians (medical, chiropractic, osteopathic, naturopathic) who employ massage therapists</h2>
<h2>* In healthcare and rehabilitation facilities</h2>
<h2>* In health and athletic clubs</h2>
<h2>* In spas and resorts</h2>
<h2>* Become a well-respected instructor of massage therapy</h2>
<h2>For you to take advantage of these opportunities, we truly believe the North Carolina School of Advanced Bodywork, Inc. (NCSAB) is a unique school specializing in providing you with the most advanced clinical and medical massage therapy training available in the country.</h2>

<h2>What, exactly, will you be able to do when you’ve graduated?</h2>
<h2>Well, it’s a wide-open field, ripe for innovation and creativity. Your medical massage therapy career has a wide range of possibilities, limited only by your imagination. And of course, you don’t have to go the clinical / medical route if you prefer the relaxation / spa end of the market.</h2>
<h2>Yet having that clinical / medical knowledge and skill will enhance your value wherever you work.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Physicians and Clinical / Medical Massage & Structural Bodywork</h2>
<h2>Another opportunity is working with physicians who understand the value of soft tissue therapy treatments for many of their patients’ painful afflictions that are difficult to treat by other means. Many physicians hire massage / bodywork therapists to work in their clinics or hospitals.</h2>
<h2>Others refer to therapists in private practice or at the many specialized therapy clinics featuring massage and bodywork.</h2>
<h2>You’ll become an expert at understanding and working with such soft tissue issues, helping your clients achieve the results they’re looking for. Physicians very much appreciate the relief and improvement you provide their patients.</h2>
<h2>Your ability to “think and work structurally” with clients and patients, revealing to them our insights, strategies, and techniques, will give you that “edge” you need to be a highly valued practitioner by all.</h2>
<h2>Of course, you’ll be free to work with private clients without a physician’s referral or supervision, yet the more relationships you build with medical and healthcare professionals, the greater your referral base will be.</h2>
<h2>It is our job to make you so knowledgeable, skilled, and conversant about soft tissue issues and their causes that physicians will quickly realize you truly are an expert in our field of healthcare.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Anti-Aging or Elegant Aging Therapy</h2>
<h2>One huge market rapidly opening up is the baby boomers who have started retiring in large numbers. They are one of the most health-conscious groups of people we’ve ever seen. And many of them have sufficient funds to invest in their healthcare.</h2>
<h2>As we age, our muscles accumulate what we call C.E.M.&.N.T. (chronic, excess muscle and nerve tension and stress), also known as “tight muscles,” usually including hardening of the surrounding fascia and “tightening” of the tendons. As muscles, fascia, and tendons tighten, harden, and shorten, various aches and pains, reduced function, and pathologies very often result.</h2>
<h2>We have found many of the symptoms people experience are, basically, little more than “tight muscles.” Yet their negative effects can profoundly influence the function and comfort of the human body. Eventually, this negatively affects their quality of life as well.</h2>
<h2>Although it is, of course, ideally best for them to work with you preventively before they have too many problems and soft tissue issues to deal with, in many cases, it will be when their quality of life is diminished or suffering that they’ll be far more motivated to seek your services.</h2>
<h2>Your newfound ability will be to help clients feel, relax, lengthen, and balance their soft tissues—their muscles, fascia, and tendons. This, in turn, with radical relaxation, decompresses tendons, joints, ligaments, and other tissues and structures of their body. That, in turn, reduces or relieves many of the problems arising from such “tight muscles and fascia.”</h2>
<h2>Your training allows you to provide, via deep neuro-musculo-fascial relaxation, in turn providing “anti-aging” or “elegant aging” therapy for clients who want to proactively reduce the tensions and stresses in their bodies, keeping them feeling younger and more vital. YOU will help them prevent many of the afflictions affecting so many people as they get older.</h2>
<h2>We call it “Myo-Structural Decompression & Balancing.” And you’ll know how to do this when you complete your training at NCSAB. … (“MYO-” means “musculo-.”)</h2>
<h2>This decompression and balancing process can take a few weeks to a few months. Then they often switch to a “maintenance mode” where they come in, for example, on a monthly basis for “tune-up” sessions.</h2>
<h2>An entire practice can be built on that approach alone. After a few years, many forward-thinking and well-trained therapists can be booked up for the entire year just on their maintenance appointments.</h2>

<h2>Athletes and sports enthusiasts who use their bodies a lot can benefit in many ways. For example, golfers need specialized therapy to maximize their follow-through on their golf swing, not to mention relieving the stresses and tensions that naturally build up while playing golf.</h2>
<h2>Working with professional athletes and/or sports teams can be a very rewarding career path.</h2>
<h2>The NCSAB does not teach the “standard” sports massage methods. Many sports massage methods have a standard “routine” for performing a more generic sports massage service. We at NCSAB have our own approach, where we directly target an athlete’s or musician’s specific challenges and address them with tailor-made sessions.</h2>
<h2>And our manual technique, with our “No Pain, More Gain” method, provides a unique experience most experienced clients say they’ve never experienced before. You’ll learn how to do this style of therapy at NCSAB.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Maternity & Infant Massage & Bodywork</h2>
<h2>For those of you with an affinity for young families and the childbearing years, maternity and infant work can be a way to channel your career—with your unique insights, knowledge, and skills—into a very rewarding niche.</h2>
<h2>A mother’s body goes through many changes during pregnancy, and many of them produce pain and dysfunction patterns due to increased tension in the musculo-fascial and neuromuscular systems.</h2>
<h2>Understanding changing gravitational pulls and how they shift as the child grows in the womb helps you understand which muscles get overly tense and stressed. You can provide relief for the many mothers who suffer discomfort, restricted range of motion, or even pain as a result of these body changes.</h2>
<h2>It is also known that very young children, from infancy onward, respond very well to proper tactile stimulation to the skin of the body. This stimulation, in turn, accelerates the growth of nerve tissues.</h2>
<h2>One interesting aspect of the health benefits of the more general style of Swedish massage is the proven effect it has on the improved development of infants. It’s been shown that children are far more well-adjusted and healthy when they’ve had sufficient touch from an early age. Infant massage has been demonstrated to improve the growth of nerve tissue and other body systems.</h2>
<h2>By virtue of the skin’s close association with the central nervous system, this cutaneous (skin) stimulation is literally awakening organic functions in the newborns’ internal organs, and without it, their chances of survival are markedly diminished.</h2>
<h2>Even those who had been previously retarded showed dramatic increases in their weight, height, energy, and mental acuity. In institution after institution, the mystery of infant marasmus* was cleared up: The tactile stimulation associated with tender, loving care was absolutely crucial to a baby’s development. Without it, no amount of food or kind of medicine could produce a healthy individual.</h2>
<h2>Juhan, Deane (2015-01-31). Job’s Body (Kindle Locations 1542-1544). Barrytown/Station Hill Press, Inc. Kindle Edition.</h2>
<h2>(* Marasmus is a form of severe malnutrition characterized by energy deficiency.)</h2>
<h2>Infant massage might well be an excellent career opportunity for therapists with an affinity for families and children. If you have an ability to teach, teaching infant massage and/or couples massage can be a great and rewarding adjunct to your practice. It also gets your name out there to a wider range of potential clients.</h2>

<h2>The value to businesses and corporations of keeping their employees happier and healthier is growing by the day, and it is getting more recognized as well. Much research is being done demonstrating the value of such wellness, stress management, and ergonomic programs.</h2>
<h2>Your insights into posture and structure, and C.E.M.&.N.T. (Chronic, Excess Muscle & Nerve Tension & Stress), can make you very valuable to a company that recognizes the value of providing their employees with ways to make them happier and healthier, with less stress and tension.</h2>
<h2>One way to get known and build a therapy practice is to develop a routine you can perform on employees while they’re sitting right in their chairs at work. Or you can bring a massage chair.</h2>
<h2>The principles and techniques you’ll learn from us are directly applicable to such environments.</h2>

<h2>Modern medical research has provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of massage and bodywork therapy for various health conditions. While the evidence is still evolving, several studies have demonstrated promising results in certain areas.</h2>
<h2>It is openly admitted that much of the medical “evidence” is not fully accepted by the orthodox medical establishment; however, there is no doubt that many clients of massage and bodywork therapists experience great relief from their symptoms.</h2>
<h2>Also, orthodox medical research tends to focus on remedies that are easily subject to double-blind studies. Yet there are so many variables in massage and bodywork that they are not readily subject to precise evaluation. There is too much subjectivity on the part of both the client and therapist.</h2>
<h2>In addition, the variability of skill and knowledge of any individual therapist varies widely. So very often, when a massage technique is being evaluated, what is really being tested is the quality and training of the therapist.</h2>
<h2>Therefore, it pays to attend a school with a long-standing reputation for graduating the most highly trained and qualified therapists.</h2>
<h2>The curriculum at NCSAB was developed and implemented by leaders in the massage and bodywork therapy field, Kyle C. Wright, LMBT, and David Phillips, LMBT. Teaching of the program is still led by David Phillips and his team of highly qualified instructors.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Pain Management</h2>
<h2>Massage therapy has shown potential benefits for managing various types of pain:</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Low Back Pain</h2>
<h2>Multiple studies have found weak to moderate evidence supporting the use of massage for low back pain [4]. Clinical guidelines issued by the American College of Physicians recommend massage as an initial treatment option for chronic low back pain [4].</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Neck Pain</h2>
<h2>A 2016 review of four randomized controlled trials found that massage therapy may provide short-term benefits for neck pain [4]. However, the effectiveness of massage for neck pain remains uncertain, and more research is needed [4].</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Osteoarthritis</h2>
<h2>Some studies suggest that massage may have short-term benefits in relieving knee pain associated with osteoarthritis [4]. A 2017 systematic review found low- to moderate-quality evidence that massage therapy is superior to non-active therapies in reducing pain and improving functional outcomes for arthritis patients [4].</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Fibromyalgia</h2>
<h2>Research indicates that massage therapy may be helpful for some fibromyalgia symptoms:</h2>
<h2>* A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that massage therapy, if continued for at least 5 weeks, improved pain, anxiety, and depression in people with fibromyalgia [4].</h2>
<h2>* A 2015 systematic review found that most styles of massage had beneficial effects on the quality of life in fibromyalgia patients, with the exception of Swedish massage [4].</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Cancer-Related Symptoms</h2>
<h2>Some studies have explored the potential benefits of massage for cancer patients:</h2>
<h2>* A 2016 Cochrane review found some studies suggesting that massage, with or without aromatherapy, may help relieve pain and anxiety in people with cancer [4]. However, the quality of evidence was very low, and results were not consistent.</h2>
<h2>* Another 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis suggested weak recommendations for massage therapy in the treatment of pain, fatigue, and anxiety in cancer patients [4].</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Immune System and Circulatory Benefits</h2>
<h2>Massage therapy has been associated with potential benefits for the immune and circulatory systems:</h2>
<h2>* Studies have shown that massage therapy can stimulate the circulatory system, improving blood and lymph flow [1].</h2>
<h2>* Massage may help boost immunity by stimulating the lymphatic system, which is one of the body’s waste-clearing mechanisms [1].</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Hormonal Effects</h2>
<h2>Research has indicated that massage therapy can influence hormone levels:</h2>
<h2>* Studies have shown that massage therapy can lower cortisol levels and increase dopamine and serotonin levels [1]. Massage may also help lower excitatory hormones like norepinephrine and epinephrine, potentially reducing feelings of anxiety [1].</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Sleep Improvement</h2>
<h2>Massage therapy may have positive effects on sleep. By stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, massage can help promote relaxation and potentially improve sleep quality [1].</h2>
<h2>While these findings are promising, it’s important to note that the overall quality of evidence for many massage therapy applications remains low to moderate. A 2024 study published in JAMA Network Open found that, despite numerous clinical trials and systematic reviews, there were few conclusions regarding massage therapy that had greater than low certainty of evidence [5].</h2>
<h2>More rigorous research is needed to establish the effectiveness of massage therapy for various conditions definitively. Future studies should focus on improving methodological quality, using appropriate comparators, and conducting longer follow-up periods to provide more conclusive evidence on the benefits of massage and bodywork therapy.</h2>

<h2>Osteoarthritis: “A 2013 review of two randomized controlled trials found positive short-term (less than 6 months) effects in the form of reduced pain and improved self-reported physical functioning. Results of a 2006 randomized controlled trial of 68 adults with OA of the knee who received standard Swedish massage over 8 weeks demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pain and physical function.”</h2>
<h2>Fibromyalgia: “A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 studies (478 total participants) compared the effects of different kinds of massage therapy and found that most styles of massage had beneficial effects on the quality of life in fibromyalgia.”</h2>

Basic Information & Schedules including
what to expect on Your First Day of School…

First Day of School - Class SchedulesOn your first day of school, Monday, you will have an orientation covering school policies and procedures. You’ll receive your textbooks and supplies, and meet your fellow starting students (Juniors) as well as the students 3 months ahead of you (Seniors). Then you will go right into the first chapter lecture in Massage.

Moving forward, on Tuesday you will start directly with the Cells & Tissues lecture. Bring a notepad or your laptop. On Wednesday you will hear the basics of what structural bodywork is and begin to learn the vocabulary,

You will learn your bones first over the first couple of weeks, then over the months to follow you will add muscle groups to those bones.

Thursday you will get on the tables to learn to touch and compress muscles.  … That’s your first week.

Moving forward you will learn a new chapter or muscle group each day and test at the end of each chapter or muscle group.

The Instructors are seasoned and have been teaching for us a long time. They are passionate and continue their own education to expand the knowledge they bring to the table. … Their gifts are the soul of our school. We are a family and you will make lifelong friends here.

At the North Carolina School of Advanced Bodywork, we want all of our students to feel at ease and comfortable as you start your education in our 650-hour Professional Massage  & Bodywork Therapy Program.

We are a small, boutique school and will give you a toolbox of knowledge giving you the ability to give a great, relaxing, stress-reducing massage as well as treat soft tissue dysfunction.

Chronic pain lives in the soft tissues. … Sciatica, Plantar Facitis, Low Back Pain, Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, and Frozen Shoulder … all are soft tissue issues.

				<h2>The following information gives a brief description of the curriculum within the Professional Massage Therapy Program & Bodywork Therapy Training. Each day is dedicated to one of the four program divisions and will often address a number of subjects in an effort to satisfy specific state requirements while ensuring that the integrity of the information remains superior.</h2>
				<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Anatomy and Physiology</h2>
				<h2>The objective of Anatomy and Physiology is to enable the student to most effectively design massage therapy techniques through an understanding of the human body. This course includes Anatomy and Physiology I and II, presented on separate days.</h2>
				<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Anatomy and Physiology I: Body Systems and Pathology</h2>
				<h2>Participation in this class will introduce the student to the body's major systems. A great deal of attention will be placed on the structure (anatomy) and functionality (physiology) of the human body. Attention is also given to common pathologies of each system and their impact on appropriate massage protocol, as well as contraindications to massage. Discussions on how each system functions individually, with special emphasis on its relevance to the practice of massage therapy, will be integrated into the lecture.</h2>
				<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Anatomy and Physiology II: Functional Anatomy</h2>
				<h2>The objective of this course is to provide the student with academic and tactile knowledge of the body planes, bony landmarks, and muscular and skeletal systems. Through PowerPoint presentations, engaging lectures, supervised palpatory trades, and demonstrations, class participants will become enthralled with an extensive study of movement.</h2>
				<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Swedish Massage and Allied Modalities</h2>
				<h2>The objective of this course is to familiarize the student with the basis from which most forms of massage are derived. The student will learn how massage is important and effective through engaging discussions of the history and theory of massage and by experiencing the beneficial value through hands-on table work. Each student will learn the classical 1-hour massage routine commonly used in spas and resorts and how to effectively employ all of the fundamental strokes. Further instruction will lead the student into a more creative and intuitive massage that represents their individuality. This class will cover Western modalities, introducing students to several massage techniques beyond Swedish massage. Additional topics covered are Hydrotherapy, Special Populations, Ethics, NC State laws, rules, and Business Practices of the Professional Massage and Bodywork Therapist.</h2>
				<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy and Myo-Structural Bodywork</h2>
				<h2>The objective of this course is to introduce the clinical aspect of massage therapy and bodywork as it pertains to this program. The subject matter of Clinical Massage and Structural Bodywork focuses on postural imbalances and faulty body mechanics that introduce or perpetuate conditions within the body, as well as pain management and reconditioning for sustained injuries. This course will provide each student with the ability to identify and treat postural distortions and muscular imbalances that often result in faulty and restricted movement patterns that can eventually lead to debilitating pain cycles. The eager student will flourish with knowledge gained under the guidance of carefully chosen instructors who were selected for their excellence in presenting the subject matter in a dynamic and informative manner. The skills learned within this class are invaluable as the demand for pain intervention becomes a more prevalent necessity within today's society.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Section 1: Foundations</h2>
<h2><strong>Welcome Chapter: Value of Soft-Tissue Therapy</strong><br>The chapter offers a brief introduction to the overall benefits of soft-tissue therapy and describes the phenomenon of Chronic, Excess Muscle and Nerve Tension (C.E.M.&.N.T.), as well as why it should be recognized as a primary cause of many afflictions that are not effectively treated by other therapies, including more typical massage and bodywork modalities.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapters 1-5</strong><br>In order to apply proper manual techniques, it is important to have a solid understanding of the principles underlying those techniques. An effective process of gathering data is necessary to know where and when to apply those techniques. A clear understanding of Chronic Excess Muscle and Nerve Tension (C.E.M.&.N.T.) and the many symptoms, syndromes, and pain it causes further enhances the therapist’s ability to tailor the strategies for the specific needs of the client. The following foundational chapters will provide the knowledge and insights for the therapist to develop an effective treatment strategy.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 1: The Components of Structure (Bones and Landmarks)</strong><br>Chapter 1 involves a palpatory study of the skeletal body to develop hand-placement skills for learning the muscles and their attachments. Topics include a study of the bones and surface features, bony landmarks, bone positioning as it relates to structure and movement, and where and how muscles attach to bones and the paths they travel over the body’s joints.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 2: Structural Analysis and Postural Assessment</strong><br>Chapter 2 discusses visualizing and analyzing the positioning of the client’s bones in space and their relationship with each other. Topics include observational skills, the application of structural anatomy and postural kinesiology, muscular imbalances, chronic bad postures, the planes of the body, and understanding how structural analysis and postural assessment allow the practitioner to determine causes of pain and dysfunction that are distant from the apparent symptom.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 3: Muscle Tension and Causes</strong><br>Chapter 3 offers an in-depth look at the various causes of muscle tension and provides insights into how it can be prevented and how it should be treated.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 4: Symptoms and Conditions of Muscle Tension</strong><br>Chapter 4 describes how muscle tension, directly and indirectly, causes specific conditions and symptoms.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 5: Principles of Reversing Muscle Tension</strong><br>Chapter 5 provides clinical approaches to soft tissues and chronic tension, including understanding why soft-tissue therapy, when improperly applied, can be ineffective or counterproductive.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Section II: Clinical Massage Therapy and Structural Bodywork</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapters 6-10</strong><br>Clinical massage therapy and structural bodywork (at one level) are two different therapy disciplines. The first, clinical massage therapy, involves the ability to understand and effectively identify and manipulate the soft tissues of the body for the purpose of reducing chronic excess muscle tensions that contribute to the onset of pain and dysfunction. Structural bodywork adds a level of sophistication in scientifically tracking down the aches, pains, and dysfunctions that are not sufficiently responsive to localized (at the location of symptoms) treatment of neuromuscular and myofascial structures.</h2>
<h2>Each chapter contains pertinent information structured in an easy-to-follow format to assist in facilitating the student’s learning of the muscles, origins, insertions, functions, and myotomes. Pain referral patterns associated with each muscle, clinical notes for discussion and reference, patient positioning, and treatment routines are all included.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 6: Posterior Lower Extremity Compartment (PLEC)</strong><br>Chapter 6 covers the muscles of the Posterior Lower Extremity Compartment (PLEC) and the related problems that can manifest in muscles of the foot, calf, posterior and lateral thigh, buttock, and hip.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 7: Anterior Torso Compartment (ATC)</strong><br>Chapter 7 covers the muscles of the Anterior Torso Compartment (ATC) and the related problems that can manifest in the muscles of the abdomen, chest, anterior neck, and jaw.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 8: Anterior Lower Extremity Compartment (ALEC)</strong><br>Chapter 8 covers the muscles of the Anterior Lower Extremity Compartment (ALEC) and the related problems that can manifest in the muscles of the foot, shin, anterior, and medial thigh.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 9: Posterior Torso Compartment (PTC)</strong><br>Chapter 9 covers the muscles of the Posterior Torso Compartment (PTC) and the related problems that can manifest in the muscles of the lower, middle, and upper back, shoulder, and posterior neck.</h2>
<h2><strong>Chapter 10: Upper Extremity Compartment (UEC)</strong><br>Chapter 10 covers the muscles of the Upper Extremity Compartment (UEC) and the related problems that can manifest in the muscles of the arm, forearm, and hand.</h2>

<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:25px !important;padding-top:85px;">Features of the Book and Course Materials</h2>

				<br>
				<h2 style="color: white!important;">Kinesiology addresses physiological, anatomical, biomechanical, pathological,

In brief, it is the science of movement & action of the body. There is the simple one muscle, one bone interaction.
Then there are the more complex actions of multiple interactions between more than one muscle and one or more bones.</h2><br><br>
<h2 style="color: white!important;">
At NCSAB, you’ll study Kinesiology so you can more precisely evaluate
 which specific muscles are most responsible for a client’s or patient’s pain or dysfunction.
This provides a more efficient & effective approach to tracking down soft tissue
 issues many, if not most, therapists have trouble resolving.</h2>

				 in Becoming a Leading Edge Therapist</h2>
			<br>
			<h2>
			The NCSAB believes there is a fundamental lack of understanding
			relative to how postural distortions directly and negatively impact the human body. 
			Many people are not aware that poor posture very often leads to musculoskeletal pathology, 
			including neuromuscular, myofascial, and various myo-structural issues.
			
			“Myo” refers to the muscular system, including the muscle fibers, 
			the musculo–fascia, and the nerves controlling them.
			
			Yet in OTHER cases, but no less important, it is the opposite. 
			Musculoskeletal pathology and pain can affect structural & postural 
			balance and distortions. <br><br>Either way, these factors are critical to 
			recovering and optimizing the health & function of the human body & mind of your clients. 
			And while pain is very often an indicator of such “soft tissue issues,” at other times, 
			their postural distortions are far MORE important than where the pain is. Sometimes, the pain distracts you
			 from where your client’s problems really are.
			<br><br>
			In our Medical Massage Therapy & Myo–Structural Balancing School, 
			we teach you how to distinguish the many, and sometimes 
			little-known, differences in determining & treating what your
			 client’s TRUE source of pain or dysfunction really is. 
			 Our advanced medical massage training sets you apart from the “standard”
			  training in most massage schools out there. Our Clinical / Medical Massage Therapy School
			uses structure & posture as a core focus for your therapeutic education, 
			helping you develop your strategy & tactics for recognizing, analyzing & treating such conditions.</h2>

			<h2 style="color:white !important;margin-bottom: 60px;">Structural Balancing & Postural Evaluation
				Structural Balancing refers to the overall analysis of the client’s personal “big picture.” 
				It includes various elements of their health history, what kinds of exercise or stretching they do,
				what accidents they’ve been in, and so on.
				<br><br>
				Postural Evaluation is a highly specific examination of where
				their bones are in space, and relative to each other. This helps 
				you understand which are the most over–shortened muscles. 
				These are very often where a client holds the most tension, stress, 
				and even trauma, and are usually the very first muscle(s) to address 
				in a proper Myo–Structural Balancing Therapy Session.<br><br>
				
				The prefix “Myo” refers to the actual treatment of the muscle(s), 
				which by traditional definition includes the MYO–FASCIA, 
				to bring the client’s physical structure back into proper balance.

				<h2 style=" text-align:left; color:#29345d;">Our advanced approach to myo-structural bodywork and medical massage therapy at our school in Charlotte, NC, includes addressing and eliminating postural distortions caused by muscular tension and myofascial imbalances. We believe the body’s inefficient opposition to gravity can cause many forms of musculoskeletal pain.</h2>

						<h2 style=" text-align:left;">You will discover how the body’s inefficient opposition to gravity can cause musculoskeletal pain and many other problems people face on a daily, hourly basis.</h2>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<h2 style=" text-align:left;">In other words, gravity forces the body’s weight to shift off the bones and onto the muscles. This shifting, altering, and compensating often leads to the formation of local pain points, trigger points (referral of pain to distant areas), deviations (unevenness) in hip and leg lengths, distortions in the pelvis and spine (misalignments), depressed or elevated shoulder girdles, collapsed (stooped or slouched) upper body, forward neck and head positioning, and many other ailments.</h2>

				<h2 style=" text-align:left; color:#29345d;">Our objective is to have students focus on musculo-fascial units that are overly “locked short” from C.E.M.&.N.T. (Chronic, Excess Muscle & Nerve Tension & Stress), specializing in resolving muscular imbalances linking poor posture, musculoskeletal pain, a wide variety of dysfunctions, and restriction of body movements. Yet sometimes, pain from other causes distorts the posture. Learning to see and understand these many factors sets you apart from other practitioners. And you will know how to recognize those differences and what to do about them.</h2>

Chronic pain is pain that is experienced on most days or every day in the past three months; and HICP is pain that limits life or work activities on most days or every day during the past three months. The links between the widespread burden of chronic pain and the country’s opioid epidemic underscore the urgency to understand and address the issue of pain.</h2>

(Chronic, Excess Muscle & Nerve Tension & Stress)</h2>
											<h2 style=" text-align:left;">As David Scott Lynn puts it, we have found many of the seemingly unresolvable problems people face to be the result of C.E.M.&.N.T. — or Chronic, Excess Muscle & Nerve Tension & Stress — or its less precise medical term, hypertonicity. Or, just “tight muscles.”</h2>
											<h2 style=" text-align:left;">This is an almost unrecognized source of trouble for large numbers of people, and few healthcare professionals or therapists have mastered the techniques, strategies, and subtleties needed to recognize, manage, or resolve this widely pervasive cause of many common problems.</h2>
											<h2 style=" text-align:left;">Because the ability to contract and relax muscles is, obviously, necessary to almost all our bodily functions on a daily basis, few recognize contracted muscles as a “problem.” The problem with that is that while everyone is pretty good at contracting their muscles, very few know how to truly de-contract, or fully relax, their muscles.</h2>
											<h2 style=" text-align:left;">Chronically contracted and over-shortened muscles become our primary focus for resolving many of the clinical, soft tissue issues therapists regularly encounter in their practices.</h2>
											<h2 style=" text-align:left;">Many muscles are excessively contracted; yet they are, at the same time, paradoxically, overly lengthened. Too many therapists think the over-lengthened muscles are “too weak.” While this often feels or appears correct, this is rarely the case. Allegedly “weak” muscles are not that common and lead to great misunderstandings on how to do therapy. Understanding the strategy and tactics necessary to evaluate and treat such “weak/strong” muscles versus “short/long” muscle paradoxes is central to the Medical Massage Therapy & Myo-Structural Balancing Process you’ll learn at NCSAB.</h2>
											<h2 style=" text-align:left;">Along those lines, a well-functioning human body wanting precise, effective, and efficient action must be able to relax or de-contract its muscles just as easily as it contracts them. The balance between musculo-fascial contraction and relaxation must be very close to equally balanced.</h2>
											<h2 style=" text-align:left;">Massage & Bodywork, along with Conscious Stretching, and other related modalities, are excellent ways to support your clients in achieving far deeper levels of relaxation — of muscular de-contraction — than they’ve ever experienced.</h2>

															<h2>"My association with Kyle Wright began many years ago. 
																He has treated me for various muscular symptoms, which have helped
																 me with my game tremendously. His knowledge of the muscular and skeletal
																  systems of the body has given me insight into how sports and muscle injuries
																   interact and the subsequent treatment plan needed to alleviate the underlying cause.
																    Kyle has a warm disposition and a keen dedication to the work he believes in.
																	 I wish him much success in the years to come."</h2>

															<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Receive your OWN massage therapy sessions!</h2>
															<h2>One of your perks for getting educated in massage and bodywork therapy is giving and receiving approximately three to four hours of therapy per week, every week, in supervised trades with fellow students.</h2>
															<h2>That alone is, we think, worth the price of admission to your new Clinical/Medical Massage Therapy School. Just learning about how to relax your own muscles is a revelation and relief for many people.</h2>
															<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:55px !important;padding-top:85px;">The Art of Relaxation</h2>
															<h2>An objective of our medical massage therapy and structural bodywork school is deep relaxation.</h2>
															<h2>As we teach you to help others relax their chronic muscle tensions, you’ll find yours starting to disappear too. And you’ll have the opportunity to learn many other ways of dealing with muscle and nerve tension often causing a person’s aches and pains.</h2>
															<h2>The reality is, there is an art of relaxation, and the more you know how to do it for yourself, the more you can help others achieve the deep relaxation their muscles need as well.</h2>

															<h2>For lots of students, their massage education is a life-changing experience. Because of the simultaneous inward and outward focus, and getting to know other human beings at a more intimate, holistic level, your sense of what’s possible in personal human interaction and the big picture of life expands dramatically.</h2>
															<h2>Like many students before you, your career will flourish with the deep satisfaction of helping people at levels only massage and bodywork therapy can, getting clients out of pain or other problems of posture, movement, and dysfunction.</h2>

															<h2 style="color:#29345d;font-weight: bold;font-family: 400 15px Inter,-apple-system,system-ui,Roboto,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;font-size:55px !important;padding-top:85px;">Living On The Leading Edge of Advanced Bodywork & Life Itself!</h2>
															<h2>As you get to know us, you’ll understand more about The Edge. It is a central key to providing great bodywork for people and managing many of the aspects of your own life and self.</h2>
															<h2>Working with THE EDGE, “deep” tissue therapy does not, should not, be painful!</h2>
															<h2>The short story is that too many people think that “deep tissue” therapy has to be painful for it to work. On the other hand, there are massage therapists who seldom or never work deep enough.</h2>
															<h2>But the best results come when your client is within their own optimal levels of sensation, on the “edges” of pain, meaning they like (or are very neutral about) what they’re feeling, and not having to tolerate the pressure you are applying to their muscles and fascia.</h2>
															<h2>One of our mottos is “It’s easier to open the door before you walk through it” and “You can’t peel an onion from the inside out.”</h2>
															<h2>Because we start well within the client’s comfort levels and have them let us know when we’re getting too deep or too intense, they develop a deep trust that we will not hurt them, allowing them to relax even more. Each thin layer of muscle — each layer of musculo-fascia is a doorway to the next layer — is relaxed, well within the client’s comfort zone. This allows us to sink through each layer without causing pain, stress, or resistance for the client. We want them to invite what we’re doing, not fight what we’re doing. Since we never, or seldom, intentionally cause them pain from the therapy itself, they can, and do, relax far more deeply. When they do feel pain, they know and trust we will back off instantly, and they become far more cooperative and interactive in their therapeutic process. In this way, we very often end up working much deeper than the “deep tissue” or other more aggressive therapists. And we can stay in the deeper tissues longer, getting more done, finding more “hot spots,” more effectively and efficiently than other methods.</h2>
															<h2>Working with The Edge keeps you, the therapist, and your client more fully focused on their internal relaxation and tension release process, rather than distracted by dealing with or resisting pain, as a result making deeper neurological connections, increasing the effectiveness, efficiency, and results of the therapy you provide for them.</h2>
															<h2>They very soon know the difference between you and other therapists. And you will learn to provide those differences at your Clinical/Medical Massage Therapy School in Charlotte, NC.</h2>
															<h2>Like much of what you’ll be learning with us, there’s a lot more to it than the above simple descriptions. Yes, our technique treats the deep tissues. Many say we go deeper than most.</h2>
															<h2>Yet in many cases, the “trick” is to let the skin and surface tissues “release” first, then go deeper, thin layer by thin layer (like working through the layers of an onion) of musculo-fascial tissue, allowing the no-pain, more-gain process to work. You’ll learn to deliver deeper bodywork with no significant levels of pain necessarily involved.</h2>
															<h2>Our entry-level program at our medical massage therapy school gives you all the tools you need to be a very successful practitioner with these methods.</h2>
													
															<h2>"In almost twenty years of practice and who knows how many continuing education courses I have taken, there have been two styles that have defined how I practice. 
																The work I learned from Kyle – 'Playing The Edge,' neuromuscular, and structural 
																rebalancing, and so much more.</h2> <h2>His training has led to my career working with neurologists, 
																neurosurgeons, OB/GYN, and pain specialists and has been especially influential in shaping my 
																role in rehabilitation.</h2> <h2>Thank you for your amazing gifts."</h2>

															<h2>Well, it’s a wide-open field, ripe for innovation and creativity.</h2>
															<h2>One huge market opening up is the Baby Boomers who have started retiring in large numbers. They are one of the most health-conscious groups of people we’ve ever seen.</h2>
															<h2>Another opportunity is working with physicians who understand the value of soft tissue therapy treatments for many of their patients’ painful afflictions difficult to treat by other means. (Although many physicians will need you to give them an education on how it all works. We’ll prepare you for those interactions.)</h2>
															<h2>"I have referred many patients to Mr. Kyle Wright, LMT, NCTMB, 
																for clinical neuromuscular and structural bodywork. These have been
																 my patients with soft tissue dysfunction, generally secondary to trauma. 
																 My experience has been positive, in that the patients involved have increased 
																 range of motion of the affected areas and have a decrease in their complaints of pain.
																  I have found this type of therapy to be a very useful modality in the treatment of 
																  soft tissue disorders. I have found Mr. Kyle Wright to be an articulate and competent therapist."</h2>
															<h2>~Ronald W. Dennie, M.D., Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation</h2>
															<h2>Another market is athletes and sports enthusiasts. Most of us have heard about top athletes who consider some form of massage or bodywork as vital to their professional success and injury prevention.</h2>
															<h2>Kyle Wright personally worked with a number of world-class, professional athletes who’ve been
																 extremely appreciative of the benefits our approach to therapy provided them.</h2>
															<h2>"But please bear in mind that if I was using techniques most therapists use,
																 and that I used in my early days as a therapist, 
																 I most likely would not have gotten the level of results I did with many of my clients." 
																~Kyle Wright</h2>
															<h2>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee how well you will do as a professional massage and bodywork therapist. Only you can determine how dedicated and hard-working you’ll be. It takes diligent, consistent work to get started, find clients, and build a practice.</h2>
															<h2>Yet in truth, you’re only limited by your imagination and willingness to work hard and smart, along with the quality of your training. And of course, if you go into private practice, like any other business, you’ll need to develop your marketing and networking skills, and we will help get you started on that.</h2>

															A Message From Kyle Wright, Founder & Developer of Florida and North Carolina Schools of Advanced Bodywork: Clinical/Medical Massage & Bodywork Therapy</h2>
															<h2></h2>
															<h2>650-hour Professional Massage & Bodywork Therapy</h2>
															<h2>“It’s always nice to see when therapists quiet their minds and quiet their hands; the recipient of the bodywork goes to a deep level of the parasympathetic state, which allows for a deeper level of entry into the musculo-fascial layers of the body. When the recipient experiences no fear, resistance, guarding, armoring, and no pain during their session, their muscles are more able to achieve relaxation and longer-lasting results.” ~Kyle Wright</h2>
